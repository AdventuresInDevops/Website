Paul recounts a legendary story from the Irish property market where a well-funded competitor attempted to solve their \\"chicken and egg\\" problem by scraping his company\'s listings. Instead of waiting years for lawyers, Paul\u2019s team fed the scrapers \\"Project Yellow Brick Road\\": fake listings that placed the British Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street in Dublin and the White House in County Cork. The result? The competitor\u2019s site went viral for all the wrong reasons, forcing them to burn resources manually filtering junk until they eventually gave up and targeted someone else.\\n\\nWe also dive into the high-stakes world of election coverage, where Paul had three weeks to build a \\"coalition builder\\" tool for a national election. The solution wasn\'t a complex microservice architecture, but a humble Google Sheet wrapped in a Cloudflare Worker. Paul explains how they mitigated Google\'s rate limits and cold start times by putting a heavy cache in front of the sheet, leading to a crucial lesson in pragmatism: data that is \\"one minute stale\\" is perfectly acceptable if it saves the engineering team from building a complex invalidation strategy. Practically wins.\\n\\nFinally, the conversation turns to the one thing that causes more sleepless nights than malicious scrapers: caching layers. Paul and the host commiserate over the \\"turtles all the way down\\" nature of modern caching, where a single misconfiguration can lead to a news site accidentally attaching a marathon runner\u2019s photo to a crime story. They wrap up with picks, including a history of cryptography that features the Pope breaking Spanish codes and a defense of North Face hiking boots that might just be \\"glamping\\" gear in disguise.\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Picks:\\n* Warren - [The North Face Hedgehog Gore-tex Hiking Shoes](https://amzn.to/3LWwFr7)\\n* Paul - [The Code Book](https://amzn.to/3NqBQjz)"},{"id":"/260-dora-report-ai-and-platform-engineering","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/260-dora-report-ai-and-platform-engineering","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/260-dora-report-ai-and-platform-engineering/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/260-dora-report-ai-and-platform-engineering/index.md","title":"Special: The DORA 2025 Critical Review","description":"Dorota, CEO of Authress, guides us on the adventure to roast the 2025 DORA report \u2014 Focusing what productivity really means, the impact to our organizations, and who AI is really for.","date":"2026-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Special: The DORA 2025 Critical Review","description":"Dorota, CEO of Authress, guides us on the adventure to roast the 2025 DORA report \u2014 Focusing what productivity really means, the impact to our organizations, and who AI is really for.","image":"./post.png","date":"2026-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","custom_youtube_embed_url":"https://youtu.be/WGZKoCHyC2A"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Project Yellow Brick Road: Creative, Practical, and Unconventional Engineering","permalink":"/episodes/261-creative-practical-unconventional-engineering"},"nextItem":{"title":"Browser Native Auth and FedCM is finally here!","permalink":"/episodes/259-federated-credentials-management-fedcm-browser-auth"}},"content":"import GuestCallout from \'@site/src/components/guestCallout\';\\nimport GuestImage from \'./guest.jpg\';\\nimport BrandImage from \'./brand.jpg\';\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \\"flex\\", justifyContent: \'space-around\', alignItems: \'center\', flexWrap: \\"wrap\\", maxWidth: \'100%\'  }}>\\n    <GuestCallout name=\\"Dorota Parad\\" link=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorota-parad\\" image={GuestImage} brandImg={BrandImage} />\\n</div>\\n\\n\\"Those memes are not going to make themselves.\\"\\n\\nDorota, CEO of [Authress](https://authress.io), joins us to roast the 2025 DORA Report, which she argues has replaced hard data with an AI-generated narrative. From the confusing disconnect between feeling productive and actually shipping code to the grim reality of a 30% acceptance rate, Warren and Dorota break down why this year\'s report smells a lot like manure.\\n\\nWe dissect the massive 142-page 2025 DORA Report. Dorota argues that the report, which is now rebranded as the \\"State of AI-Assisted Software Development\\", feels less like a scientific study of DevOps performance and more like a narrative written by an intern using an LLM prompt. The duo investigates the \\"stubborn results\\" where AI apparently makes everyone feel like a 10x developer, where the hard results tell a different story. AI actually increases software and product instability \u2014 failing to improve.\\n\\nThe conversation gets spicy as they debate the \\"pit of failure\\" that is feature flags (often used as a crutch for untested code) and the embarrassing reality that GitHub celebrates a mere 30% code acceptance rate as a \\"success.\\" Dorota suggests that while AI raises the floor for average work, it completely fails when you need to solve complex problems or, you know, actually collaborate with another human being.\\n\\nIn a vivid analogy, Dorota compares reading this year\'s report to the Swiss Spring phenomenon \u2014 the time of year when farmers spray manure, leaving the beautiful landscape smelling...unique. The episode wraps up with a reality check on the physical limits of LLM context windows (more tokens, more problems) and a strong recommendation to ignore the AI hype cycle in favor of a much faster-growing organism: a kitchen countertop oyster mushroom kit.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Notable Links:\\n* [AI as an amplifier truism fallacy](https://www.kentarotoyama.org/papers/Toyama%202011%20iConference%20-%20Technology%20as%20Amplifier.pdf)\\n* [DORA 2025 Report](https://dora.dev/research/2025/dora-report/)\\n* [DevOps Episode: VS Code & GitHub  Copilot](https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/10/31/managers-of-agents-ai-strategy)\\n* [Where is the deluge of new software](https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding) - [Impact of AI on software products](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/)\\n* [Impact of AI on Critical Thinking](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf)\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Picks:\\n* Warren - [The Maximum Effective Context Window](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21361)\\n* Dorota - [Mushroom Grow Kit](https://amzn.to/4pMIkr9)"},{"id":"/259-federated-credentials-management-fedcm-browser-auth","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/259-federated-credentials-management-fedcm-browser-auth","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/259-federated-credentials-management-fedcm-browser-auth/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/259-federated-credentials-management-fedcm-browser-auth/index.md","title":"Browser Native Auth and FedCM is finally here!","description":"Sam Goto from Chrome talks us through the treacherous adventure of getting auth into browser land","date":"2025-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Browser Native Auth and FedCM is finally here!","description":"Sam Goto from Chrome talks us through the treacherous adventure of getting auth into browser land","image":"./post.png","date":"2025-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","custom_youtube_embed_url":"https://youtu.be/L36OxItF_c0"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Special: The DORA 2025 Critical Review","permalink":"/episodes/260-dora-report-ai-and-platform-engineering"},"nextItem":{"title":"Are we building the right thing?","permalink":"/episodes/258-building-the-right-thing-ux-engineering-collaboration"}},"content":"import GuestCallout from \'@site/src/components/guestCallout\';\\nimport GuestImage from \'./guest.jpg\';\\nimport BrandImage from \'./brand.jpg\';\\nimport SponsorCallout from \'@site/src/components/sponsorCallout\';\\nimport SponsorImage from \'./sponsor.jpg\';\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \\"flex\\", justifyContent: \'space-around\', alignItems: \'center\', flexWrap: \\"wrap\\", maxWidth: \'100%\'  }}>\\n    <GuestCallout name=\\"Sam Goto\\" link=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelgoto/\\" image={GuestImage} brandImg={BrandImage} />\\n    <SponsorCallout name=\\"Incident.io\\" tagline=\\"The AI incident platform\\" link=\\"https://dev0ps.fyi/incidentio\\" image={SponsorImage} />\\n</div>\\n\\n\\"My biggest legacy at Google is the amount of systems I broke.\\" \u2014 Sam Goto joins the show with a name that strikes fear into engineering systems everywhere.

This shift allows for critical UX improvements for logging in all users irrespective of what login providers you use, finally addressing the \\"NASCAR flag\\" problem of infinite login lists.\\n\\nMost importantly, he shares why you don\'t need to change your technology stack to get all the benefits of FedCM. Finally, Sam details the \\"self-sustaining flame\\" strategy (as opposed to an ecosystem \\"flamethrower\\"), revealing how they utilized JavaScript SDKs to migrate massive platforms like Shopify and 50% of the web\'s login traffic without requiring application developers to rewrite their code.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Notable Links:\\n* [HSMs + TPM in production environments](https://authress.io/knowledge-base/academy/topics/credential-management#asymmetric-key-cryptography)\\n* [Get involved: FedCM W3C WG](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/)\\n* [The FedCM spec GitHub repo](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM)\\n* [TPAC Browser Conference](https://www.w3.org/2025/11/TPAC/)\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Picks:\\n* Warren - [Book: The Platform Revolution](https://amzn.to/4q5c3vl)\\n* Sam - [The 7 Laws of Identity](https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352) and [Short Story: The Egg By Andy Weir](https://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg.html)"},{"id":"/258-building-the-right-thing-ux-engineering-collaboration","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/258-building-the-right-thing-ux-engineering-collaboration","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/258-building-the-right-thing-ux-engineering-collaboration/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/258-building-the-right-thing-ux-engineering-collaboration/index.md","title":"Are we building the right thing?","description":"Elise Stanley Brevald walks us through what it means to focus on the user experience and how to collaborate with Engineering effectively.","date":"2025-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Are we building the right thing?","description":"Elise Stanley Brevald walks us through what it means to focus on the user experience and how to collaborate with Engineering effectively.","image":"./post.png","date":"2025-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","custom_youtube_embed_url":"https://youtu.be/4hfSIPuZMvM"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Browser Native Auth and FedCM is finally here!","permalink":"/episodes/259-federated-credentials-management-fedcm-browser-auth"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why Your Code Dies in Six Months: Automated Refactoring","permalink":"/episodes/2025/11/20/managing-code-decay-automated-refactoring"}},"content":"import GuestCallout from \'@site/src/components/guestCallout\';\\nimport GuestImage from \'./guest.jpg\';\\nimport BrandImage from \'./brand.svg\';\\nimport SponsorCallout from \'@site/src/components/sponsorCallout\';\\nimport SponsorImage from \'./sponsor.jpg\';\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \\"flex\\", justifyContent: \'space-around\', alignItems: \'center\', flexWrap: \\"wrap\\", maxWidth: \'100%\'  }}>\\n    <GuestCallout name=\\"Elise Stanley Brevald\\" link=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elise-stanley-brevald-7701351a\\" image={GuestImage}>\\n        <BrandImage />\\n    </GuestCallout>\\n    <SponsorCallout name=\\"Incident.io\\" tagline=\\"The AI incident platform\\" link=\\"https://dev0ps.fyi/incidentio\\" image={SponsorImage} />\\n</div>\\n\\nElise, VP and Head of UX at Unleash, joins us to talk all about UX.

Olga reveals a shocking statistic: without maintenance, cloud-native applications often cease to function within just six months. And from our experience, that\'s actually optimistic. The rapid decay isn\'t always due to bad code choices, but rather the shifting sands of third-party dependencies, which make up 80 to 90% of cloud-native environments.\\n\\nWe review the limitations of traditional Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and the introduction of OpenRewrite\'s Lossless Semantic Trees (LSTs). Unlike standard tools, LSTs preserve formatting and style, allowing for automated, horizontal scaling of code maintenance across millions of lines of code. This fits perfectly in to the toolchain that is the LLMs and open source ecosystem. Olga explains how this technology enables enterprises to migrate frameworks\u2014like moving from Spring Boot 1 to 2 \u2014 without dedicating entire years to manual updates.\\n\\nFinally, they explore the intersection of AI and code maintenance, noting that while LLMs are great at generating code, they often struggle with refactoring and optimizing existing codebases. We highlight that agents are not yet fully autonomous and will always require \\"right-sized\\" data to function effectively. Will is absent for this episode, leaving Warren to navigate the complexities of mass-scale code remediation solo.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Notable Links:\\n* [DevOps Episode: We read code](https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/10/31/managers-of-agents-ai-strategy)\\n* [DevOps Episode: Dynamic PRs from incidents](https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/10/20/solving-incidents-with-one-time-ephemeral-runbooks)\\n* [OpenRewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org/)\\n* [Larger Context Windows are not better](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21361)\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Picks:\\n* Warren - [Dell XPS 13 9380](https://amzn.to/4oPEHzS)\\n* Olga - [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code)"},{"id":"/2025/10/31/managers-of-agents-ai-strategy","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/2025/10/31/managers-of-agents-ai-strategy","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/2025-10-31-managers-of-agents-ai-strategy/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/2025-10-31-managers-of-agents-ai-strategy/index.md","title":"AI, IDEs, Copilot & Critical Thinking","description":"John Papa shares insights into the creation of VS Code, GitHub Copilot, where software testing went wrong, experiences at Disney, and what comes next for AI.","date":"2025-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"AI, IDEs, Copilot & Critical Thinking","description":"John Papa shares insights into the creation of VS Code, GitHub Copilot, where software testing went wrong, experiences at Disney, and what comes next for AI.","image":"./post.png","date":"2025-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","custom_youtube_embed_url":"https://youtu.be/JoJ-wEI_y_w"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why Your Code Dies in Six Months: Automated Refactoring","permalink":"/episodes/2025/11/20/managing-code-decay-automated-refactoring"},"nextItem":{"title":"Solving incidents with one-time ephemeral runbooks","permalink":"/episodes/2025/10/20/solving-incidents-with-one-time-ephemeral-runbooks"}},"content":"import GuestCallout from \'@site/src/components/guestCallout\';\\nimport GuestImage from \'./guest.jpg\';\\nimport BrandImage from \'./brand.jpg\';\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \\"flex\\", justifyContent: \'space-around\', alignItems: \'center\', flexWrap: \\"wrap\\", maxWidth: \\"100%\\" }}>\\n    <GuestCallout name=\\"John Papa\\" link=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/papajohn\\" image={GuestImage} brandImg={BrandImage} />\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft\'s John Papa, Partner General Manager of Developer Relations for all things dev and code joins the show to talk developer relations...from his Mac.

Andrew explains how their company\'s core business model is to deploy their software directly into their customers\' cloud environments. This decision was driven by the need to handle highly sensitive data, like PII and financial records, that customers don\'t want to hand over to a third-party startup. \\n\\nThe conversation delves into the surprising and complex challenges of this approach, which include managing granular IAM permissions and dealing with hidden global policies that can block their application. Andrew and Warren also discuss the real-world network congestion issues that affect cross-cloud traffic, a problem they\'ve encountered multiple times. Andrew shares Chalk\'s mature philosophy on software releases, where they prioritize backwards compatibility to prevent customer churn, which is a key learning from a competitor.\\n\\nFinally, the episode explores the advanced technical solutions Chalk has built, such as their unique approach to \\"bitemporal modeling\\" to prevent training bias in machine learning datasets. As well as, the decision to move from Python to C++ and Rust for performance, using a symbolic interpreter to execute customer code written in Python without a Python runtime. The episode concludes with picks, including a surprisingly popular hobby and a unique take on high-quality chocolate.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Notable Links:\\n* Fact - [The $1M hidden Kubernetes spend](https://downloads.portainer.io/whitepapers/portainer-the-true-cost-of-kubernetes-platform-adoption.pdf)\\n* [Giraffe and Medical Ruler training data bias](https://www.bdo.com/insights/digital/unpacking-ai-bias#:~:text=Because%20diagnostic%20photos%2C%20like%20those,characteristic%20of%20malignant%20skin%20lesions.)\\n* [SOLID principles don\'t produce better code?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD5NrevFtbU)\\n* [Veritasium - The Hole at the Bottom of Math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo)\\n* [Episode: Auth Showdown on backwards compatible changes](https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/07/17/auth-showdown-single-versus-multitenant-architecture/)\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Picks:\\n* Warren - [Switzerland Grocery Store Chocolate](https://www.migros.ch/en/content/frey)\\n* Andrew - [Trek E-Bikes](https://www.trekbikes.com/)"},{"id":"/2025/09/07/how-you-build-observability-that-scales-to-enterprise","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/2025/09/07/how-you-build-observability-that-scales-to-enterprise","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/2025-09-07-how-you-build-observability-that-scales-to-enterprise/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/2025-09-07-how-you-build-observability-that-scales-to-enterprise/index.md","title":"How to build in Observability at Petabyte Scale","description":"Ang Li, Director of Engineering at Observe, shares how they built a petabyte-scale observability platform using Snowflake, Kafka, and open data formats.","date":"2025-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"How to build in Observability at Petabyte Scale","description":"Ang Li, Director of Engineering at Observe, shares how they built a petabyte-scale observability platform using Snowflake, Kafka, and open data formats.","image":"./post.jpg","date":"2025-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","custom_youtube_embed_url":"https://youtu.be/Sp_UBqZE8jI"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The Unspoken Challenges of Deploying to Customer Clouds","permalink":"/episodes/2025/09/17/chosing-the-best-database-for-ml"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Open-Source Product Leader Challenge: Navigating Community, Code, and Collaboration Chaos","permalink":"/episodes/2025/08/24/infrastructure-as-code-using-llms-and-critical-thinking"}},"content":"import GuestCallout from \'@site/src/components/guestCallout\';\\nimport GuestImage from \'./guest.jpg\';\\nimport BrandImage from \'./brand.jpg\';\\n\\n<GuestCallout name=\\"Ang Li \\" link=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/angliphd/\\" image={GuestImage} brandImg={BrandImage} />\\n\\nWe welcome guest Ang Li and dive into the immense challenge of observability at scale, where some customers are generating petabytes of data per day. Ang explains that instead of building a database from scratch\u2014a decision he says went \\"against all the instincts\\" of a founding engineer\u2014Observe chose to build its platform on top of Snowflake, leveraging its separation of compute and storage on EC2 and S3.\\n\\nThe discussion delves into the technical stack and architectural decisions, including the use of Kafka to absorb large bursts of incoming customer data and smooth it out for Snowflake\'s batch-based engine. Ang notes this choice was also strategic for avoiding tight coupling with a single cloud provider like AWS Kinesis, which would hinder future multi-cloud deployments on GCP or Azure. The discussion also covers their unique pricing model, which avoids surprising customers with high bills by providing a lower cost for data ingestion and then using a usage-based model for queries. This is contrasted with Warren\'s experience with his company\'s user-based pricing, which can lead to negative customer experiences when limits are exceeded.\\n\\nThe episode also explores Observe\'s \\"love-hate relationship\\" with Snowflake, as Observe\'s usage accounts for over 2% of Snowflake\'s compute, which has helped them discover a lot of bugs but also caused sleepless nights for Snowflake\'s on-call engineers. Ang discusses hedging their bets for the future by leveraging open data formats like Iceberg, which can be stored directly in customer S3 buckets to enable true data ownership and portability. The episode concludes with a deep dive into the security challenges of providing multi-account access to customer data using IAM trust policies, and a look at the personal picks from the hosts.\\n\\n## Notable Links\\n* Fact - [Passkeys: Phishing on Google\'s own domain](https://www.adaptivesecurity.com/blog/gmail-phishing-google-sites-scam) and [It isn\'t even new](https://mashable.com/article/google-sites-phishing-scams)\\n* [Episode: All About OTEL](https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/everything-is-amazing-with-otel/)\\n* [Episode: Self Healing Systems](https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/self-healing-systems/)\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Picks:\\n* Warren - [The Shadow (1994 film)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111143/)\\n* Ang - [XREAL Pro AR Glasses](https://www.xreal.com/air/)"},{"id":"/2025/08/24/infrastructure-as-code-using-llms-and-critical-thinking","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/2025/08/24/infrastructure-as-code-using-llms-and-critical-thinking","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/2025-08-24-infrastructure-as-code-using-llms-and-critical-thinking/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/2025-08-24-infrastructure-as-code-using-llms-and-critical-thinking/index.md","title":"The Open-Source Product Leader Challenge: Navigating Community, Code, and Collaboration Chaos","description":"Pulumi\'s GM Meagan Cojocar tackles the product leader\'s journey, the future of open source, her experience at AWS versus Pulumi, and the philosophical debate around LLMs in DevOps.","date":"2025-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"The Open-Source Product Leader Challenge: Navigating Community, Code, and Collaboration Chaos","description":"Pulumi\'s GM Meagan Cojocar tackles the product leader\'s journey, the future of open source, her experience at AWS versus Pulumi, and the philosophical debate around LLMs in DevOps.","image":"./post.jpeg","date":"2025-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","custom_youtube_embed_url":"https://youtu.be/K_ltF1rRV7M"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to build in Observability at Petabyte Scale","permalink":"/episodes/2025/09/07/how-you-build-observability-that-scales-to-enterprise"},"nextItem":{"title":"FinOps: Holding engineering teams accountable for spend","permalink":"/episodes/2025/07/31/finops-cost-optimization-devops-kubernetes"}},"content":"import GuestCallout from \'@site/src/components/guestCallout\';\\nimport GuestImage from \'./guest.jpg\';\\nimport BrandImage from \'./brand.jpg\';\\n\\n<GuestCallout name=\\"Meagan Cojocar \\" link=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meagancojocar/\\" image={GuestImage} brandImg={BrandImage} />\\n\\nIn a special solo flight, Warren welcomes Meagan Cojocar, General Manager at [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) and a self-proclaimed graduate of \u201cPM school\u201d at AWS. They dive into what it\'s like to own an entire product line and why giving up that startup hustle for the big leagues sometimes means you miss the direct signal from your users. The conversation goes deep on the paradox of open-source where direct feedback is gold, but dealing with license-shifting competitors can make you wary. From the notorious HashiCorp kerfuffle to the rise of OpenTofu, they explore how Pulumi maintains its commitment to the community amidst a wave of customer distrust.\\n\\nMeagan highlights the invaluable feedback loop provided by the community, allowing for direct interaction between users and the engineering team. This contrasts with the \\"telephone game\\" that can happen in proprietary product development. The conversation also addresses the recent industry shift and then immediate back-peddling from open-source licenses, discussing the subsequent customer distrust and how Pulumi maintains its commitment to the open-source model.\\n\\nAnd finally, the duo tackles the elephant in the cloud: LLMs, and extends on the earlier [MCP episode](https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/mcp-servers-and-agent-interactions/). They debate the great code quality vs. speed trade-off, the risk of a \\"botched\\" infrastructure deployment, and whether these models can solve anything more than a glorified statistical guessing game. It\'s a candid look at the future of DevOps, where the real chaos isn\'t the code, but the tools that write it. The conversation concludes with a philosophical debate on the fundamental capabilities of LLMs, questioning whether they can truly solve \\"hard problems\\" or are merely powerful statistical next-word predictors.\\n\\n## Notable Links\\n* [Veritasium - the Math that predicts everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZeIEiBrT_w)\\n* Fact - [Don\'t outsource your customer support: Clorox sues Cognizant](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/how-do-hackers-get-passwords-sometimes-they-just-ask/)\\n* [CloudFlare uses an LLM to generate an OAuth2 Library](https://neilmadden.blog/2025/06/06/a-look-at-cloudflares-ai-coded-oauth-library/)\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Picks:\\n* Warren - [Rands Leadership Community](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/)\\n* Meagan - [The Manager\'s Path by Camille Fournier](https://amzn.to/48SfvnA)"},{"id":"/2025/07/31/finops-cost-optimization-devops-kubernetes","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/2025/07/31/finops-cost-optimization-devops-kubernetes","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/2025-07-31-finops-cost-optimization-devops-kubernetes/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/2025-07-31-finops-cost-optimization-devops-kubernetes/index.md","title":"FinOps: Holding engineering teams accountable for spend","description":"We explore what exactly is FinOps supposed to mean and the core goal for engineering teams.

Yasmin Rajabi, Chief Strategy Officer at CloudBolt, joins us to demystify, as we acknowledge the critical challenge of bringing together financial accountability and engineering teams who often are not paying attention to the business.\\n\\nThe discussion further explores the practicalities of FinOps in the context of cloud spending and Kubernetes. Yasmin highlights that a significant amount of waste in organizations comes from simply not turning off unused systems and not right-sizing resources. She explains how tools like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) can help, but also points out the complexities of optimizing across horizontal and vertical scaling behaviors. The conversation touches on \\"shame back reporting\\" as a way to provide visibility into costs for engineering teams, although the conversation emphasizes that providing tooling and insights is more effective than simply telling developers to change configurations.\\n\\nThe episode also delves into the evolving mindset around cloud costs, especially with the rise of AI and machine learning workloads. While historically engineering salaries eclipsed cloud spending, the increasing hardware requirements for ML and data workloads are making cost optimization a more pressing concern. Spending-conscious teams are increasingly asking about GPU optimization, even if AI/ML teams are still largely focused on limitless spending to drive unjustified \\"innovation\\". The conclude by discussing the challenges of on-premise versus cloud deployments and the importance of addressing \\"day two problems\\" regardless of the infrastructure choice.\\n\\n ## \ud83c\udfaf Picks:\\n * Warren - [Lions and Dolphins cannot make babies](https://kording.substack.com/p/lions-and-dolphins-can-not-make-babies)\\n - Aimee - [The Equip Protein Powder and Protein Bar](https://www.equipfoods.com/products/prime-bar)\\n - Yasmin - [Bone Broth drink by 1990 Snacks](https://1990snacks.com/)\\n\\n---"},{"id":"/2025/07/17/auth-showdown-single-versus-multitenant-architecture","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/2025/07/17/auth-showdown-single-versus-multitenant-architecture","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/2025-07-17-auth-showdown-single-versus-multitenant-architecture/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/2025-07-17-auth-showdown-single-versus-multitenant-architecture/index.md","title":"The Auth Showdown: Single tenant versus Multitenant Architectures","description":"The Auth experts square off hoping to get to the bottom of which architecture is truly best with guest Brian Pontarelli.","date":"2025-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"The Auth Showdown: Single tenant versus Multitenant Architectures","description":"The Auth experts square off hoping to get to the bottom of which architecture is truly best with guest Brian Pontarelli.","image":"./post.png","date":"2025-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","custom_youtube_embed_url":"https://youtu.be/XI8qYgc3fts"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"FinOps: Holding engineering teams accountable for spend","permalink":"/episodes/2025/07/31/finops-cost-optimization-devops-kubernetes"},"nextItem":{"title":"Should We Be Using Kubernetes: Did the Best Product Win?","permalink":"/episodes/2025/06/25/kubernetes-deep-dive-and-critical-review-of-ai"}},"content":"import GuestCallout from \'@site/src/components/guestCallout\';\\nimport GuestImage from \'./guest.jpeg\';\\nimport BrandImage from \'./brand.jpeg\';\\n\\n<GuestCallout name=\\"Brian Pontarelli\\" link=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/voidmain\\" image={GuestImage} brandImg={BrandImage} />\\n\\nGet ready for a lively debate on this episode of Adventures in DevOps. We\'re joined by Brian Pontarelli, founder of FusionAuth and CleanSpeak. Warren and Brian face off by diving into the controversial topic of multitenant versus single-tenant architecture. Expert co-host Aimee Knight joins to moderate the discussion. Ever wondered how someone becomes an \\"auth expert\\"? Warren spills the beans on his journey, explaining it\'s less about a direct path and more about figuring out what it means for yourself. Brian chimes in with his own \\"random chance\\" story, revealing how they fell into it after their forum-based product didn\'t pan out.\\n\\nAimee confesses her \\"alarm bells\\" start ringing whenever multitenant architecture is mentioned, jokingly demanding \\"details\\" and admitting her preference for more separation when it comes to reliability. Brian makes a compelling case for his company\'s chosen path, explaining how their high-performance, downloadable single-tenant profanity filter, CleanSpeak, handles billions of chat messages a month with extreme low latency. This architectural choice became a competitive advantage, attracting companies that couldn\'t use cloud-based multitenant competitors due to their need to run solutions in their own data centers.\\n\\nWe critique cloud providers\' tendency to push users towards their most profitable services, citing AWS Cognito as an example of a cost-effective solution for small-scale use that becomes cost-prohibitive with scaling and feature enablement. The challenges of integrating with Cognito, including its reliance on numerous other AWS services and the need for custom Lambda functions for configuration, are also a point of contention. The conversation extends to the frustrations of managing upgrades and breaking changes in both multitenant and single-tenant systems and the inherent difficulties of ensuring compatibility across different software versions and integrations. The episode concludes with a humorous take on the current state and perceived limitations of AI in software development, particularly concerning security.\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Picks:\\n- Warren - [Scarpa Hiking shoes - Planet Mojito Suade](https://world.scarpa.com/product/26407274/mojito-lifestyle-sneakers-for-leisure-sports-travel-thyme-green)\\n- Aimee - [Peloton Tread](https://www.onepeloton.com/tread)\\n- Brian - [Searchcraft](https://www.searchcraft.io/) and [Fight or Flight](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13652286/)"},{"id":"/2025/06/25/kubernetes-deep-dive-and-critical-review-of-ai","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/2025/06/25/kubernetes-deep-dive-and-critical-review-of-ai","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/2025-06-25-kubernetes-deep-dive-and-critical-review-of-ai/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/2025-06-25-kubernetes-deep-dive-and-critical-review-of-ai/index.md","title":"Should We Be Using Kubernetes: Did the Best Product Win?","description":"A critical look at Kubernetes\' dominance and was AI a mistake?

Omer Hamerman joins Will and Warren to take a hard look at it. Despite the rise of serverless solutions promising to abstract away infrastructure management, Omer shares that Kubernetes has seen a surge in adoption, with potentially 70-75% of corporations now using or migrating to it. We explore the theory that human nature\'s preference for incremental \\"step changes\\" (Kaizen) over disruptive \\"giant leaps\\" (Kaikaku) might explain why a solution perceived by some as \\"worse\\" or more complex has gained such widespread traction.\\n\\nThe discussion unpacks the undeniable strengths of Kubernetes, including its \\"thriving community\\", its remarkable extensibility through APIs, and how it inadvertently created \\"job security\\" for engineers who \\"nerd out\\" on its intricacies. We also challenge the narrative by examining why serverless options like AWS Fargate could often be a more efficient and less burdensome choice for many organizations, especially those not requiring deep control or specialized hardware like GPUs. The conversation highlights that the perceived \\"need\\" for Kubernetes\' emerges often from something other than technical superiority.\\n\\nFinally, we consider the disruptive influence of AI and \\"vibe coding\\" on this landscape, how could we not? As LLMs are adopted to \\"accelerate development\\", they tend to favor serverless deployment models, implicitly suggesting that for rapid product creation, Kubernetes might not be the optimal fit. This shift raises crucial questions about the trade-offs between development speed and code quality, the evolving role of software engineers towards code review, and the long-term maintainability of AI-generated code. We close by pondering the broader societal and environmental implications of these technological shifts, including AI\'s massive energy consumption and the ongoing debate about centralizing versus decentralizing infrastructure for efficiency.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Notable Links:\\n- [Comparison: Linux versus E. coli](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/linux-versus-e-coli)\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Picks:\\n- Warren - Surveys are great, and also fill in the [Podcast Survey](https://adventuresindevops.com/survey)\\n- Will - [Katana.network](https://katana.network/)\\n- Omer - [Mobland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31510819/) and [JJ (Jujutsu)](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/) \\n\\n<div className=\\"image-md\\">\\n\\n![What vibe coders were doing before AI](./vibe-coders.jpeg)\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"sre-insights-from-the-streaming-world","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/sre-insights-from-the-streaming-world","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/0-archive/sre-insights-from-the-streaming-world/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/0-archive/sre-insights-from-the-streaming-world/index.md","title":"Mastering SRE: Insights in Scale and at Capacity","description":"Join Aimee Knight as she shares her journey and insights into the world of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).","date":"2025-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Mastering SRE: Insights in Scale and at Capacity","description":"Join Aimee Knight as she shares her journey and insights into the world of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).","image":"./post.png","date":"2025-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","custom_youtube_embed_url":"https://youtu.be/YvD_5aiKXHY","slug":"sre-insights-from-the-streaming-world"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Should We Be Using Kubernetes: Did the Best Product Win?","permalink":"/episodes/2025/06/25/kubernetes-deep-dive-and-critical-review-of-ai"},"nextItem":{"title":"Exploring MCP Servers and Agent Interactions","permalink":"/episodes/mcp-servers-and-agent-interactions"}},"content":"import GuestCallout from \'@site/src/components/guestCallout\';\\nimport GuestImage from \'./guest.jpeg\';\\nimport BrandImage from \'./brand.jpeg\';\\n\\n<GuestCallout name=\\"Aimee Knight\\" link=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aimeemarieknight/\\" image={GuestImage} brandImg={BrandImage} />\\n\\nIn this episode, Aimee Knight, an expert in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) whose experience hails from Paramount and NPM, joins the podcast to discuss her journey into SRE, the challenges she faced, and the strategies she employed to succeed.

She also delves into the complexities of SRE at different scales, the role of playbooks in incident management, and the balance between speed and quality in software development.\\n\\nAimee discusses the impact of AI and machine learning on SRE, emphasizing the need for responsible use of these tools. She touches on the importance of understanding business needs and how it affects decision-making in SRE roles. The conversation also covers the trade-offs in system design, the challenges of scaling applications, and the importance of resilience in distributed systems. Aimee provides valuable insights into the pros and cons of a career in SRE, including the importance of self-care and the satisfaction of mentoring others.\\n\\nThe episode concludes with us discussing some of the hard problems such as the on-call burden for large teams, and the technical expertise an org needs to maintain higher complexity systems. Is the average tenure in tech decreasing, we discuss it and do a deep dive on the consequences in the SRE world.\\n\\n[![Superman used for maximum efficiency](./smbc-superman-2305.jpg)](https://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305)\\n\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Picks:\\n    - [Warren\'s Technical Blog](http://dev.to/wparad)\\n    - Warren: [The Fifth Discipline by Peter Senge](https://amzn.to/4nJ3IMC)\\n    - Aimee: Sleep Token (Band) - [Caramel](https://youtu.be/4iSvoQNfrrk?si=7Fz9BbJ3AM0gnw7j), [Granite](https://youtu.be/om4dEGKnEmw?si=zi87FTA2RsYc8Xif)\\n    - Will: [The Bear Grylls Celebrity Hunt on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/ch-en/title/81701547)\\n    - Jillian: [Horizon Zero Dawn Video Game](https://www.horizon.game/)"},{"id":"mcp-servers-and-agent-interactions","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/mcp-servers-and-agent-interactions","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/0-archive/mcp-servers-and-agent-interactions/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/0-archive/mcp-servers-and-agent-interactions/index.md","title":"Exploring MCP Servers and Agent Interactions","description":"Dive into the world of MCP servers and agent interactions with Gil Feig.","date":"2025-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Exploring MCP Servers and Agent Interactions","description":"Dive into the world of MCP servers and agent interactions with Gil Feig.","image":"./post.png","date":"2025-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","custom_youtube_embed_url":"https://youtu.be/ErIIeKKtB30","slug":"mcp-servers-and-agent-interactions"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Mastering SRE: Insights in Scale and at Capacity","permalink":"/episodes/sre-insights-from-the-streaming-world"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Blog Post Release Automation","permalink":"/episodes/podcast-automation-review"}},"content":"import GuestCallout from \'@site/src/components/guestCallout\';\\nimport GuestImage from \'./guest.jpg\';\\nimport BrandImage from \'./brand.jpg\';\\n\\n<GuestCallout name=\\"Gil Feig\\" link=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilfeig/\\" image={GuestImage} brandImg={BrandImage} />\\n\\nIn this episode, we delve into the concept of MCP (Machine Control Protocol) servers and their role in enabling agent interactions.

Of course all the episodes are available on our podcast website as well other streaming platforms.\\n\\nBut! Since we\'re a technical podcast, we decided to make our infrastructure open source (On [GitHub](https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website) unfortunately), but to go further it also uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) to publish the [episodes to our website](https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml). There is of course the nasty bit of actually recording the episodes, editing the episodes, and then downloading and formatting them to make them nice.\\n\\nAfter that is all done though, it is time to create the episode page and most importantly the cornerstone of ever podcast, **an awesome episode image**.\\n\\nSo let\'s get down to it.\\n\\n## Execution\\nInterestingly enough, the Nova Lite model failed completely attempting to request it to actually build the command I needed to execute the model itself. Not very self-aware, you might say.\\n\\nHowever using other models I was able to coax out the following recommendation:\\n\\nWith the episode saved in the transcript.txt file, and the instructions we want to run in the instructions.txt\\n\\n```js\\n#!/usr/bin/env node\\n\\nimport { BedrockRuntimeClient, InvokeModelCommand } from \'@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime\';\\nimport fs from \'fs/promises\';\\nimport path from \'path\';\\nimport { fileURLToPath } from \'url\';\\n\\n// Resolve file paths\\nconst __dirname = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));\\nconst instructionsPath = path.resolve(__dirname, \'instructions.txt\');\\nconst transcriptPath = path.resolve(__dirname, \'transcript.txt\');\\n\\n// Set up Bedrock client\\nconst client = new BedrockRuntimeClient({\\n  region: \'eu-west-1\'\\n});\\n\\n(async () => {\\n  try {\\n    // Read both input files\\n    const [instructions, transcript] = await Promise.all([\\n      fs.readFile(instructionsPath, \'utf-8\'),\\n      fs.readFile(transcriptPath, \'utf-8\')\\n    ]);\\n\\n    // Build prompt\\n    const content = `Instructions:\\\\n${instructions}\\\\n\\\\nTranscript:\\\\n---\\\\n${transcript}\\\\n---`;\\n\\n    const payload = {\\n      messages: [{\\n        role: \'user\',\\n        content\\n      }],\\n      // Max Token Count and other parameters: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-titan-text.html\\n      temperature: 0.7,\\n      top_p: 0.9,\\n      max_tokens: 4096\\n    };\\n\\n    // Invoke the model\\n    const command = new InvokeModelCommand({\\n      modelId: \'amazon.nova-lite-v1:0\',\\n      contentType: \'application/json\',\\n      accept: \'application/json\',\\n      body: JSON.stringify(payload)\\n    });\\n\\n    const response = await client.send(command);\\n\\n    // Decode and print response\\n    const responseBody = await response.body.transformToString();\\n    console.log(\'\u2705 Model response:\\\\n\');\\n    console.log(responseBody.output.message.context);\\n  } catch (err) {\\n    console.error(\'\u274c Failed to invoke model:\', err);\\n    process.exit(1);\\n  }\\n})();\\n```\\n\\nAnd that\'s it, we can take the output create a pull request and then release the episode.\\n\\n\\n## Troubleshooting\\n\\nOf course nothing works the first time, and for us the first issue is\\n\\n```\\nFailed to invoke model: ValidationException: Invocation of model ID amazon.nova-lite-v1:0 with on-demand throughput isn\'t supported. Retry your request with the ID or ARN of an inference profile that contains this mode.\\n```\\n\\nOkay turns out there is some magic that it takes to run the Nova model in other regions, so instead of trying to get that to work, we\'ll switch to the region `us-east-1`.\\n\\n```\\nMalformed input request: #: required key [messages] not found, please reformat your input and try again.\\n```\\n\\nHmmm, weird, it turns out there have been some serious changes to the API, in which the documentation is not really up to date. So figuring out the correct parameters is actually a bit of a problem.\\n\\nBut setting the payload as just:\\n\\n```js\\nconst payload = {\\n      messages: [{\\n        role: \'user\',\\n        content: [{\\n          // type: \\"text\\",\\n          text: inputText\\n        }]\\n      }]\\n      // Max Token Count and other parameters: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-titan-text.html\\n      // temperature: 0.7\\n      // top_p: 0.9,\\n      // max_tokens: 4096\\n    };\\n```\\n\\nSolves most of this problem.\\n\\n![Nova self fail result](./nova-self-fail.webp)\\n\\nAlthough one problem we keep running into is that the Nova Modals \\"Content\\" filter keeps blocking itself. Even sending the very innocuous \\"hey\\" to the model to generate three images, fails after the first one.\\n\\nSuccess!?\\n\\n## The podcast image\\n\\nThe next step is run the generator a second time, but this time use the output from the first step as the input to generate an image relevant to the podcast.\\n\\nThere are a couple of changes that have to be made.\\n\\n1. We don\'t need the transcript anymore since we already have a summary.\\n2. We need to pass an input image, we don\'t want some random picture we want something that is brand aware.\\n3. The output will be an image as well.\\n\\nSo instead we\'ll use the Nova Canvas model: `amazon.nova-canvas-v1:0` with the parameters:\\n\\n```js\\nconst payload = {\\n      messages: [\\n        {\\n          role: \'user\',\\n          content: [\\n            { text: inputText },\\n            {\\n              image: {\\n                format: \'jpeg\',\\n                source: {\\n                  bytes: (await fs.readFile(logoImage)).toString(\'base64\')\\n                }\\n              }\\n            },\\n            {\\n              image: {\\n                format: \'png\',\\n                source: {\\n                  bytes: (await fs.readFile(referenceImage)).toString(\'base64\')\\n                }\\n              }\\n            }\\n          ]\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    };\\n```\\n\\n## The result\\n\\nWe\'ll I think pictures are way more expressive than words, so check out the latest episode here on [Adventures in DevOps](https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes) to see how exactly well we did!\\n\\n## Our Verdict\\n\\nNova is not ready for prime time. For now, we are going to try out some of the other models offered through Bedrock and focus on getting more high quality content.
