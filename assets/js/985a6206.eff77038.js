Omer Hamerman joins Will and Warren to take a hard look at it. Despite the rise of serverless solutions promising to abstract away infrastructure management, Omer shares that Kubernetes has seen a surge in adoption, with potentially 70-75% of corporations now using or migrating to it. We explore the theory that human nature\'s preference for incremental \\"step changes\\" (Kaizen) over disruptive \\"giant leaps\\" (Kaikaku) might explain why a solution perceived by some as \\"worse\\" or more complex has gained such widespread traction.\\n\\nThe discussion unpacks the undeniable strengths of Kubernetes, including its \\"thriving community\\", its remarkable extensibility through APIs, and how it inadvertently created \\"job security\\" for engineers who \\"nerd out\\" on its intricacies. We also challenge the narrative by examining why serverless options like AWS Fargate could often be a more efficient and less burdensome choice for many organizations, especially those not requiring deep control or specialized hardware like GPUs. The conversation highlights that the perceived \\"need\\" for Kubernetes\' emerges often from something other than technical superiority.\\n\\nFinally, we consider the disruptive influence of AI and \\"vibe coding\\" on this landscape, how could we not? As LLMs are adopted to \\"accelerate development\\", they tend to favor serverless deployment models, implicitly suggesting that for rapid product creation, Kubernetes might not be the optimal fit. This shift raises crucial questions about the trade-offs between development speed and code quality, the evolving role of software engineers towards code review, and the long-term maintainability of AI-generated code. We close by pondering the broader societal and environmental implications of these technological shifts, including AI\'s massive energy consumption and the ongoing debate about centralizing versus decentralizing infrastructure for efficiency.\\n\\n## Links:\\n- [Comparison: Linux versus E. coli](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/linux-versus-e-coli)\\n\\n## Picks  \\n- Warren - Surveys are great, and also fill in the [Podcast Survey](https://adventuresindevops.com/survey)\\n- Will - [Katana.network](https://katana.network/)\\n- Omer - [Mobland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31510819/) and [JJ (Jujutsu)](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/) \\n\\n<div className=\\"image-md\\">\\n\\n![What vibe coders were doing before AI](./vibe-coders.jpeg)\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/sre-insights-from-the-streaming-world","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/sre-insights-from-the-streaming-world","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/sre-insights-from-the-streaming-world/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/sre-insights-from-the-streaming-world/index.md","title":"Mastering SRE: Insights in Scale and at Capacity","description":"Join Aimee Knight as she shares her journey and insights into the world of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).","date":"2025-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"custom_slug":"sre-insights-from-the-streaming-world","hide_table_of_contents":true,"title":"Mastering SRE: Insights in Scale and at Capacity","description":"Join Aimee Knight as she shares her journey and insights into the world of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).","image":"./post.png","date":"2025-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","custom_youtube_embed_url":"https://youtu.be/YvD_5aiKXHY"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Should We Be Using Kubernetes: Did the Best Product Win?","permalink":"/episodes/2025/06/25/kubernetes-deep-dive-and-critical-review-of-ai"},"nextItem":{"title":"Exploring MCP Servers and Agent Interactions","permalink":"/episodes/mcp-servers-and-agent-interactions"}},"content":"import GuestCallout from \'@site/src/components/guestCallout\';\\nimport GuestImage from \'./guest.jpeg\';\\nimport BrandImage from \'./brand.jpeg\';\\n\\n<GuestCallout name=\\"Aimee Knight\\" link=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aimeemarieknight/\\" image={GuestImage} brandImg={BrandImage} />\\n\\nIn this episode, Aimee Knight, an expert in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) whose experience hails from Paramount and NPM, joins the podcast to discuss her journey into SRE, the challenges she faced, and the strategies she employed to succeed.

Of course all the episodes are available on our podcast website as well other streaming platforms.\\n\\nBut! Since we\'re a technical podcast, we decided to make our infrastructure open source (On [GitHub](https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website) unfortunately), but to go further it also uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) to publish the [episodes to our website](https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml). There is of course the nasty bit of actually recording the episodes, editing the episodes, and then downloading and formatting them to make them nice.\\n\\nAfter that is all done though, it is time to create the episode page and most importantly the cornerstone of ever podcast, **an awesome episode image**.\\n\\nSo let\'s get down to it.\\n\\n## Execution\\nInterestingly enough, the Nova Lite model failed completely attempting to request it to actually build the command I needed to execute the model itself. Not very self-aware, you might say.\\n\\nHowever using other models I was able to coax out the following recommendation:\\n\\nWith the episode saved in the transcript.txt file, and the instructions we want to run in the instructions.txt\\n\\n```js\\n#!/usr/bin/env node\\n\\nimport { BedrockRuntimeClient, InvokeModelCommand } from \'@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime\';\\nimport fs from \'fs/promises\';\\nimport path from \'path\';\\nimport { fileURLToPath } from \'url\';\\n\\n// Resolve file paths\\nconst __dirname = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));\\nconst instructionsPath = path.resolve(__dirname, \'instructions.txt\');\\nconst transcriptPath = path.resolve(__dirname, \'transcript.txt\');\\n\\n// Set up Bedrock client\\nconst client = new BedrockRuntimeClient({\\n  region: \'eu-west-1\'\\n});\\n\\n(async () => {\\n  try {\\n    // Read both input files\\n    const [instructions, transcript] = await Promise.all([\\n      fs.readFile(instructionsPath, \'utf-8\'),\\n      fs.readFile(transcriptPath, \'utf-8\')\\n    ]);\\n\\n    // Build prompt\\n    const content = `Instructions:\\\\n${instructions}\\\\n\\\\nTranscript:\\\\n---\\\\n${transcript}\\\\n---`;\\n\\n    const payload = {\\n      messages: [{\\n        role: \'user\',\\n        content\\n      }],\\n      // Max Token Count and other parameters: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-titan-text.html\\n      temperature: 0.7,\\n      top_p: 0.9,\\n      max_tokens: 4096\\n    };\\n\\n    // Invoke the model\\n    const command = new InvokeModelCommand({\\n      modelId: \'amazon.nova-lite-v1:0\',\\n      contentType: \'application/json\',\\n      accept: \'application/json\',\\n      body: JSON.stringify(payload)\\n    });\\n\\n    const response = await client.send(command);\\n\\n    // Decode and print response\\n    const responseBody = await response.body.transformToString();\\n    console.log(\'\u2705 Model response:\\\\n\');\\n    console.log(responseBody.output.message.context);\\n  } catch (err) {\\n    console.error(\'\u274c Failed to invoke model:\', err);\\n    process.exit(1);\\n  }\\n})();\\n```\\n\\nAnd that\'s it, we can take the output create a pull request and then release the episode.\\n\\n\\n## Troubleshooting\\n\\nOf course nothing works the first time, and for us the first issue is\\n\\n```\\nFailed to invoke model: ValidationException: Invocation of model ID amazon.nova-lite-v1:0 with on-demand throughput isn\u2019t supported. Retry your request with the ID or ARN of an inference profile that contains this mode.\\n```\\n\\nOkay turns out there is some magic that it takes to run the Nova model in other regions, so instead of trying to get that to work, we\'ll switch to the region `us-east-1`.\\n\\n```\\nMalformed input request: #: required key [messages] not found, please reformat your input and try again.\\n```\\n\\nHmmm, weird, it turns out there have been some serious changes to the API, in which the documentation is not really up to date. So figuring out the correct parameters is actually a bit of a problem.\\n\\nBut setting the payload as just:\\n\\n```js\\nconst payload = {\\n      messages: [{\\n        role: \'user\',\\n        content: [{\\n          // type: \\"text\\",\\n          text: inputText\\n        }]\\n      }]\\n      // Max Token Count and other parameters: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-titan-text.html\\n      // temperature: 0.7\\n      // top_p: 0.9,\\n      // max_tokens: 4096\\n    };\\n```\\n\\nSolves most of this problem.\\n\\n![Nova self fail result](./nova-self-fail.webp)\\n\\nAlthough one problem we keep running into is that the Nova Modals \\"Content\\" filter keeps blocking itself. Even sending the very innocuous \\"hey\\" to the model to generate three images, fails after the first one.\\n\\nSuccess!?\\n\\n## The podcast image\\n\\nThe next step is run the generator a second time, but this time use the output from the first step as the input to generate an image relevant to the podcast.\\n\\nThere are a couple of changes that have to be made.\\n\\n1. We don\'t need the transcript anymore since we already have a summary.\\n2. We need to pass an input image, we don\'t want some random picture we want something that is brand aware.\\n3. The output will be an image as well.\\n\\nSo instead we\'ll use the Nova Canvas model: `amazon.nova-canvas-v1:0` with the parameters:\\n\\n```js\\nconst payload = {\\n      messages: [\\n        {\\n          role: \'user\',\\n          content: [\\n            { text: inputText },\\n            {\\n              image: {\\n                format: \'jpeg\',\\n                source: {\\n                  bytes: (await fs.readFile(logoImage)).toString(\'base64\')\\n                }\\n              }\\n            },\\n            {\\n              image: {\\n                format: \'png\',\\n                source: {\\n                  bytes: (await fs.readFile(referenceImage)).toString(\'base64\')\\n                }\\n              }\\n            }\\n          ]\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    };\\n```\\n\\n## The result\\n\\nWe\'ll I think pictures are way more expressive than words, so check out the latest episode here on [Adventures in DevOps](https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes) to see how exactly well we did!\\n\\n## Our Verdict\\n\\nNova is not ready for prime time. For now, we are going to try out some of the other models offered through Bedrock and focus on getting more high quality content. Quality and reliability are crucial here as we aim to cut down on time to create the episode releases."},{"id":"/high-performance-cloud-edge-infrastructure-strategy","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/high-performance-cloud-edge-infrastructure-strategy","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/high-performance-cloud-edge-infrastructure-strategy/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/high-performance-cloud-edge-infrastructure-strategy/index.md","title":"No Lag: Building the Future of High-Performance Cloud","description":"Vultr\u2019s Nathan Goulding breaks down bare metal, global edge deployments, and why GPU clusters are warping the laws of cloud physics.","date":"2025-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"custom_slug":"high-performance-cloud-edge-infrastructure-strategy","hide_table_of_contents":true,"title":"No Lag: Building the Future of High-Performance Cloud","description":"Vultr\u2019s Nathan Goulding breaks down bare metal, global edge deployments, and why GPU clusters are warping the laws of cloud physics.","image":"./post.png","date":"2025-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","custom_youtube_embed_url":"https://youtu.be/11Y-hALPydo"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The Blog Post Release Automation","permalink":"/episodes/podcast-automation-review"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ground Truth & Guided Journeys: Rethinking Data for AI","permalink":"/episodes/semantic-data-governance-enterprise-knowledge-graphs"}},"content":"import GuestCallout from \'@site/src/components/guestCallout\';\\nimport GuestImage from \'./guest.jpg\';\\nimport BrandImage from \'./brand.jpg\';\\n\\n<GuestCallout name=\\"Nathan Goulding\\" link=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathangoulding/\\" image={GuestImage} brandImg={BrandImage} />\\n\\nWarren talks with Nathan Goulding, SVP of Engineering at [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/), about what it actually takes to run a high-performance cloud platform.

From his wild career transition out of financial services into 24/7 node ops for Web3, Paul shares the brutal truth about uptime expectations, decentralization challenges, and why hard forks are more like enterprise schema upgrades with a community twist. If you\u2019ve ever wondered why managing a blockchain node is like owning a temperamental pet server, this one\u2019s for you.\\n\\nThe team goes deep on the nitty-gritty of load balancing across dozens of chains, explaining why routing traffic to the \u201cwrong\u201d archive node could ruin your day\u2014and how Ankr\u2019s custom load balancer is basically magic for JSON-RPC calls. Warren tosses out wild scenarios about encrypted data smuggling via blockchain, while Will confesses his angry typing habit (yes, it\u2019s back). The discussion gets even more fun with debates on innovation vs. rigor, Web2\'s forgotten best practices, and why testing in prod might not be such a dirty word after all.\\n\\nBut don\u2019t think it\u2019s all crypto and code. Paul shares battle-won wisdom from running over 100 chains across bare metal, giving us a peek at the operational sophistication and automation involved. From Terraform templates to Docker configs, he walks through the process of onboarding new chains and tuning for performance. The episode also touches on emerging risks like data exfiltration via public blockchains, and why AI (used wisely) might just be the sidekick DevOps always needed.\\n\\nAnd of course memes, we talk a bit about this one:\\n\\n<div className=\\"episode-embedded-image\\">\\n\\n![Project management done poorly demonstrated with a tire swing as a parody of software development](./project-management-communication-meme.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n## Picks  \\n- Warren: [Dvorak Keyboard Setup and Logitech K295](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mk295-keyboard-mouse-combo.920-009782)  \\n- Will: [Quirky Record Player from Miniot](https://miniot.com/)  \\n- Paul: [Super Whisper - Voice Transcription Tool](https://superwhisper.com)"},{"id":"/everything-is-amazing-with-otel","metadata":{"permalink":"/episodes/everything-is-amazing-with-otel","editUrl":"https://github.com/AdventuresInDevops/Website/tree/main/episodes/everything-is-amazing-with-otel/index.md","source":"@site/episodes/everything-is-amazing-with-otel/index.md","title":"Observability in CI/CD & Beyond with Adriana Villela","description":"Adriana Villela joins the pod to talk observability, CI/CD pipelines, and how far OpenTelemetry can really go.","date":"2025-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"hide_table_of_contents":true,"title":"Observability in CI/CD & Beyond with Adriana Villela","description":"Adriana Villela joins the pod to talk observability, CI/CD pipelines, and how far OpenTelemetry can really go.","image":"./post.png","date":"2025-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","custom_youtube_embed_url":"https://youtu.be/0J2ACLI2tUM"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Decentralized Chaos: Web3 Infra, NodeOps, and the Art of Blockchain Load Balancing","permalink":"/episodes/web3-is-going-great-with-infra-and-layers"},"nextItem":{"title":"Internal Developer Portals & Engineering Excellence with Ganesh Datta","permalink":"/episodes/internal-developer-portals-and-engineering-excellence"}},"content":"import GuestCallout from \'@site/src/components/guestCallout\';\\nimport GuestImage from \'./guest.jpg\';\\nimport BrandImage from \'./brand.jpg\';\\n\\n<GuestCallout name=\\"Adriana Villela\\" link=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianavillela\\" image={GuestImage} brandImg={BrandImage} />\\n\\nIn this episode, Will and Warren welcome Adriana Villela \u2014 CNCF ambassador, Dynatrace advocate, and host of the [*Geeking Out* podcast](https://www.linkedin.com/company/geeking-out-podcast/) \u2014 for a wide-ranging conversation on observability in CI/CD pipelines.
