      <title>The Productivity Delusion: Gizmos, Resentment Metrics, and the Art of Deleting Code</title>

Paul recounts a legendary story from the Irish property market where a well-funded competitor attempted to solve their "chicken and egg" problem by scraping his company's listings. Instead of waiting years for lawyers, Paul’s team fed the scrapers "Project Yellow Brick Road": fake listings that placed the British Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street in Dublin and the White House in County Cork. The result? The competitor’s site went viral for all the wrong reasons, forcing them to burn resources manually filtering junk until they eventually gave up and targeted someone else.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>We also dive into the high-stakes world of election coverage, where Paul had three weeks to build a "coalition builder" tool for a national election. The solution wasn't a complex microservice architecture, but a humble Google Sheet wrapped in a Cloudflare Worker. Paul explains how they mitigated Google's rate limits and cold start times by putting a heavy cache in front of the sheet, leading to a crucial lesson in pragmatism: data that is "one minute stale" is perfectly acceptable if it saves the engineering team from building a complex invalidation strategy. Practically wins.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Finally, the conversation turns to the one thing that causes more sleepless nights than malicious scrapers: caching layers. Paul and the host commiserate over the "turtles all the way down" nature of modern caching, where a single misconfiguration can lead to a news site accidentally attaching a marathon runner’s photo to a crime story. They wrap up with picks, including a history of cryptography that features the Pope breaking Spanish codes and a defense of North Face hiking boots that might just be "glamping" gear in disguise.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>🎯 Picks:</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>Warren - <a href="https://amzn.to/3LWwFr7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The North Face Hedgehog Gore-tex Hiking Shoes</a></li><li>Paul - <a href="https://amzn.to/3NqBQjz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Code Book</a></li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>Special: The DORA 2025 Critical Review</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/260-dora-report-ai-and-platform-engineering" target="_blank">Share Episode</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those memes are not going to make themselves."</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Dorota, CEO of <a href="https://authress.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Authress</a>, joins us to roast the 2025 DORA Report, which she argues has replaced hard data with an AI-generated narrative. From the confusing disconnect between feeling productive and actually shipping code to the grim reality of a 30% acceptance rate, Warren and Dorota break down why this year's report smells a lot like manure.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>We dissect the massive 142-page 2025 DORA Report. Dorota argues that the report, which is now rebranded as the "State of AI-Assisted Software Development", feels less like a scientific study of DevOps performance and more like a narrative written by an intern using an LLM prompt. The duo investigates the "stubborn results" where AI apparently makes everyone feel like a 10x developer, where the hard results tell a different story. AI actually increases software and product instability — failing to improve.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The conversation gets spicy as they debate the "pit of failure" that is feature flags (often used as a crutch for untested code) and the embarrassing reality that GitHub celebrates a mere 30% code acceptance rate as a "success." Dorota suggests that while AI raises the floor for average work, it completely fails when you need to solve complex problems or, you know, actually collaborate with another human being.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>In a vivid analogy, Dorota compares reading this year's report to the Swiss Spring phenomenon — the time of year when farmers spray manure, leaving the beautiful landscape smelling...unique. The episode wraps up with a reality check on the physical limits of LLM context windows (more tokens, more problems) and a strong recommendation to ignore the AI hype cycle in favor of a much faster-growing organism: a kitchen countertop oyster mushroom kit.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>💡 Notable Links:</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li><a href="https://www.kentarotoyama.org/papers/Toyama%202011%20iConference%20-%20Technology%20as%20Amplifier.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI as an amplifier truism fallacy</a></li><li><a href="https://dora.dev/research/2025/dora-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DORA 2025 Report</a></li><li><a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/10/31/managers-of-agents-ai-strategy" target="_blank">DevOps Episode: VS Code & GitHub  Copilot</a></li><li><a href="https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Where is the deluge of new software</a> - <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Impact of AI on software products</a></li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Impact of AI on Critical Thinking</a></li></ul><b>🎯 Picks:</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>Warren - <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Maximum Effective Context Window</a></li><li>Dorota - <a href="https://amzn.to/4pMIkr9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mushroom Grow Kit</a></li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>Why Your Code Dies in Six Months: Automated Refactoring</title>

Olga reveals a shocking statistic: without maintenance, cloud-native applications often cease to function within just six months. And from our experience, that's actually optimistic. The rapid decay isn't always due to bad code choices, but rather the shifting sands of third-party dependencies, which make up 80 to 90% of cloud-native environments.</p><p>We review the limitations of traditional Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and the introduction of OpenRewrite's Lossless Semantic Trees (LSTs). Unlike standard tools, LSTs preserve formatting and style, allowing for automated, horizontal scaling of code maintenance across millions of lines of code. This fits perfectly in to the toolchain that is the LLMs and open source ecosystem. Olga explains how this technology enables enterprises to migrate frameworks—like moving from Spring Boot 1 to 2 — without dedicating entire years to manual updates.</p><p>Finally, they explore the intersection of AI and code maintenance, noting that while LLMs are great at generating code, they often struggle with refactoring and optimizing existing codebases.

John leaves us with the one question we must ask of all new AI features: "Who asked for that?"</p><b>💡 Notable Links:</b><br /><ul><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Impact of AI on Critical Thinking paper</a></li><li><a href="https://dorotaparad.ch/aiaiaiaiai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LLMs raise the floor not the ceiling</a></li><li><a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/10/20/solving-incidents-with-one-time-ephemeral-runbooks" target="_blank">DevOps Episode: How far along with AI are we?</a></li></ul><b>🎯 Picks:</b><br /><ul><li>Warren - <a href="https://amzn.to/47wwQ3r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shokz OpenFit 2</a></li><li>John - <a href="https://www.rundisney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Run Disney</a></li></ul>]]></itunes:summary>

      <title>The Unspoken Challenges of Deploying to Customer Clouds</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/09/17/chosing-the-best-database-for-ml</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/09/17/chosing-the-best-database-for-ml" target="_blank">Share Episode</a><br /><br />This episode we are joined by Andrew Moreland, co-founder of <a href="https://chalk.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chalk</a>. Andrew explains how their company's core business model is to deploy their software directly into their customers' cloud environments. This decision was driven by the need to handle highly sensitive data, like PII and financial records, that customers don't want to hand over to a third-party startup. </p><p>The conversation delves into the surprising and complex challenges of this approach, which include managing granular IAM permissions and dealing with hidden global policies that can block their application. Andrew and Warren also discuss the real-world network congestion issues that affect cross-cloud traffic, a problem they've encountered multiple times. Andrew shares Chalk's mature philosophy on software releases, where they prioritize backwards compatibility to prevent customer churn, which is a key learning from a competitor.</p><p>Finally, the episode explores the advanced technical solutions Chalk has built, such as their unique approach to "bitemporal modeling" to prevent training bias in machine learning datasets. As well as, the decision to move from Python to C++ and Rust for performance, using a symbolic interpreter to execute customer code written in Python without a Python runtime. The episode concludes with picks, including a surprisingly popular hobby and a unique take on high-quality chocolate.</p><b>💡 Notable Links:</b><br /><ul><li>Fact - <a href="https://downloads.portainer.io/whitepapers/portainer-the-true-cost-of-kubernetes-platform-adoption.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The $1M hidden Kubernetes spend</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bdo.com/insights/digital/unpacking-ai-bias#:~:text=Because%20diagnostic%20photos%2C%20like%20those,characteristic%20of%20malignant%20skin%20lesions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giraffe and Medical Ruler training data bias</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD5NrevFtbU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOLID principles don't produce better code?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Veritasium - The Hole at the Bottom of Math</a></li><li><a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/07/17/auth-showdown-single-versus-multitenant-architecture/" target="_blank">Episode: Auth Showdown on backwards compatible changes</a></li></ul><b>🎯 Picks:</b><br /><ul><li>Warren - <a href="https://www.migros.ch/en/content/frey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switzerland Grocery Store Chocolate</a></li><li>Andrew - <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trek E-Bikes</a></li></ul>]]></description>

      <itunes:title>The Unspoken Challenges of Deploying to Customer Clouds</itunes:title>
      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/09/17/chosing-the-best-database-for-ml" target="_blank">Share Episode</a><br /><br />This episode we are joined by Andrew Moreland, co-founder of <a href="https://chalk.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chalk</a>. Andrew explains how their company's core business model is to deploy their software directly into their customers' cloud environments. This decision was driven by the need to handle highly sensitive data, like PII and financial records, that customers don't want to hand over to a third-party startup. </p><p>The conversation delves into the surprising and complex challenges of this approach, which include managing granular IAM permissions and dealing with hidden global policies that can block their application. Andrew and Warren also discuss the real-world network congestion issues that affect cross-cloud traffic, a problem they've encountered multiple times. Andrew shares Chalk's mature philosophy on software releases, where they prioritize backwards compatibility to prevent customer churn, which is a key learning from a competitor.</p><p>Finally, the episode explores the advanced technical solutions Chalk has built, such as their unique approach to "bitemporal modeling" to prevent training bias in machine learning datasets. As well as, the decision to move from Python to C++ and Rust for performance, using a symbolic interpreter to execute customer code written in Python without a Python runtime. The episode concludes with picks, including a surprisingly popular hobby and a unique take on high-quality chocolate.</p><b>💡 Notable Links:</b><br /><ul><li>Fact - <a href="https://downloads.portainer.io/whitepapers/portainer-the-true-cost-of-kubernetes-platform-adoption.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The $1M hidden Kubernetes spend</a></li><li><a href="https://www.bdo.com/insights/digital/unpacking-ai-bias#:~:text=Because%20diagnostic%20photos%2C%20like%20those,characteristic%20of%20malignant%20skin%20lesions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giraffe and Medical Ruler training data bias</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD5NrevFtbU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOLID principles don't produce better code?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Veritasium - The Hole at the Bottom of Math</a></li><li><a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/07/17/auth-showdown-single-versus-multitenant-architecture/" target="_blank">Episode: Auth Showdown on backwards compatible changes</a></li></ul><b>🎯 Picks:</b><br /><ul><li>Warren - <a href="https://www.migros.ch/en/content/frey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switzerland Grocery Store Chocolate</a></li><li>Andrew - <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trek E-Bikes</a></li></ul>]]></itunes:summary>

      <title>How to build in Observability at Petabyte Scale</title>

Ang explains that instead of building a database from scratch—a decision he says went "against all the instincts" of a founding engineer—Observe chose to build its platform on top of Snowflake, leveraging its separation of compute and storage on EC2 and S3.</p><p>The discussion delves into the technical stack and architectural decisions, including the use of Kafka to absorb large bursts of incoming customer data and smooth it out for Snowflake's batch-based engine. Ang notes this choice was also strategic for avoiding tight coupling with a single cloud provider like AWS Kinesis, which would hinder future multi-cloud deployments on GCP or Azure. The discussion also covers their unique pricing model, which avoids surprising customers with high bills by providing a lower cost for data ingestion and then using a usage-based model for queries. This is contrasted with Warren's experience with his company's user-based pricing, which can lead to negative customer experiences when limits are exceeded.</p><p>The episode also explores Observe's "love-hate relationship" with Snowflake, as Observe's usage accounts for over 2% of Snowflake's compute, which has helped them discover a lot of bugs but also caused sleepless nights for Snowflake's on-call engineers. Ang discusses hedging their bets for the future by leveraging open data formats like Iceberg, which can be stored directly in customer S3 buckets to enable true data ownership and portability.

      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/07/31/finops-cost-optimization-devops-kubernetes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this episode of Adventures in DevOps, we dive into the world of FinOps, a concept that aims to apply the DevOps mindset to financial accountability. Yasmin Rajabi, Chief Strategy Officer at CloudBolt, joins us to demystify, as we acknowledge the critical challenge of bringing together financial accountability and engineering teams who often are not paying attention to the business.<br /><br />The discussion further explores the practicalities of FinOps in the context of cloud spending and Kubernetes. Yasmin highlights that a significant amount of waste in organizations comes from simply not turning off unused systems and not right-sizing resources. She explains how tools like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) can help, but also points out the complexities of optimizing across horizontal and vertical scaling behaviors. The conversation touches on "shame back reporting" as a way to provide visibility into costs for engineering teams, although the conversation emphasizes that providing tooling and insights is more effective than simply telling developers to change configurations.<br /><br />The episode also delves into the evolving mindset around cloud costs, especially with the rise of AI and machine learning workloads. While historically engineering salaries eclipsed cloud spending, the increasing hardware requirements for ML and data workloads are making cost optimization a more pressing concern. Spending-conscious teams are increasingly asking about GPU optimization, even if AI/ML teams are still largely focused on limitless spending to drive unjustified "innovation". The conclude by discussing the challenges of on-premise versus cloud deployments and the importance of addressing "day two problems" regardless of the infrastructure choice.<br /><br /><b>Picks</b><br /><ul><li>Warren - <a href="https://kording.substack.com/p/lions-and-dolphins-can-not-make-babies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lions and Dolphins cannot make babies</a></li><li>Aimee - <a href="https://www.equipfoods.com/products/prime-bar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Equip Protein Powder and Protein Bar</a></li><li>Yasmin - <a href="https://1990snacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bone Broth drink by 1990 Snacks</a></li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>The Auth Showdown: Single tenant versus Multitenant Architectures</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/2025/07/17/auth-showdown-single-versus-multitenant-architecture</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Get ready for a lively debate on this episode of Adventures in DevOps. We're joined by Brian Pontarelli, founder of FusionAuth and CleanSpeak. Warren and Brian face off by diving into the controversial topic of multitenant versus single-tenant architecture. Expert co-host Aimee Knight joins to moderate the discussion. Ever wondered how someone becomes an "auth expert"? Warren spills the beans on his journey, explaining it's less about a direct path and more about figuring out what it means for yourself. Brian chimes in with his own "random chance" story, revealing how they fell into it after their forum-based product didn't pan out.<br /><br />Aimee confesses her "alarm bells" start ringing whenever multitenant architecture is mentioned, jokingly demanding "details" and admitting her preference for more separation when it comes to reliability. Brian makes a compelling case for his company's chosen path, explaining how their high-performance, downloadable single-tenant profanity filter, CleanSpeak, handles billions of chat messages a month with extreme low latency. This architectural choice became a competitive advantage, attracting companies that couldn't use cloud-based multitenant competitors due to their need to run solutions in their own data centers.<br /><br />We critique cloud providers' tendency to push users towards their most profitable services, citing AWS Cognito as an example of a cost-effective solution for small-scale use that becomes cost-prohibitive with scaling and feature enablement. The challenges of integrating with Cognito, including its reliance on numerous other AWS services and the need for custom Lambda functions for configuration, are also a point of contention. The conversation extends to the frustrations of managing upgrades and breaking changes in both multitenant and single-tenant systems and the inherent difficulties of ensuring compatibility across different software versions and integrations. The episode concludes with a humorous take on the current state and perceived limitations of AI in software development, particularly concerning security.<br /><br /><b>Picks</b><br /><ul><li>Warren - <a href="https://world.scarpa.com/product/26407274/mojito-lifestyle-sneakers-for-leisure-sports-travel-thyme-green" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scarpa Hiking shoes - Planet Mojito Suade</a></li><li>Aimee - <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/tread" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peloton Tread</a></li><li>Brian - <a href="https://www.searchcraft.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Searchcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13652286/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fight or Flight</a></li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>Should We Be Using Kubernetes: Did the Best Product Win?</title>

Omer Hamerman joins Will and Warren to take a hard look at it. Despite the rise of serverless solutions promising to abstract away infrastructure management, Omer shares that Kubernetes has seen a surge in adoption, with potentially 70-75% of corporations now using or migrating to it. We explore the theory that human nature's preference for incremental "step changes" (Kaizen) over disruptive "giant leaps" (Kaikaku) might explain why a solution perceived by some as "worse" or more complex has gained such widespread traction.<br /><br />The discussion unpacks the undeniable strengths of Kubernetes, including its "thriving community", its remarkable extensibility through APIs, and how it inadvertently created "job security" for engineers who "nerd out" on its intricacies. We also challenge the narrative by examining why serverless options like AWS Fargate could often be a more efficient and less burdensome choice for many organizations, especially those not requiring deep control or specialized hardware like GPUs. The conversation highlights that the perceived "need" for Kubernetes' emerges often from something other than technical superiority.<br /><br />Finally, we consider the disruptive influence of AI and "vibe coding" on this landscape, how could we not? As LLMs are adopted to "accelerate development", they tend to favor serverless deployment models, implicitly suggesting that for rapid product creation, Kubernetes might not be the optimal fit. This shift raises crucial questions about the trade-offs between development speed and code quality, the evolving role of software engineers towards code review, and the long-term maintainability of AI-generated code.

      <title>Exploring MCP Servers and Agent Interactions with Gil Feig</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/mcp-servers-and-agent-interactions</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this episode, we delve into the concept of MCP (Machine Control Protocol) servers and their role in enabling agent interactions. Gil Feig, the co-founder and CTO of <a href="https://www.merge.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Merge</a>, shares insights on how MCP servers facilitate efficient and secure integration between various services and APIs.<br /><br />The discussion covers the benefits and challenges of using MCP servers, including their stateful nature, security considerations, and the importance of understanding real-world use cases. Gil emphasizes the need for thorough testing and evaluation to ensure that MCP servers effectively meet user needs.<br /><br />Additionally, we explore the implications of MCP servers on data security, scaling, and the evolving landscape of API interactions. Warren chimes in with experiences integrating AI with Auth. Will stuns us with some nuclear fission history. And finally, we also touch on the balance between short-term innovation and long-term stability in technology, reflecting on how different generations approach problem-solving and knowledge sharing.<br /><br />Picks<a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/mcp-servers-and-agent-interactions/#picks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">​</a>:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/survey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Adventures In DevOps: Survey</a></li><li>Warren: <a href="https://amzn.to/4o0lM55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Magicians by Lev Grossman</a></li><li>Gil: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Constant Escapement in Watchmaking</a></li><li>Will: <a href="https://amzn.to/42lsbQa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeon Crawler Carl</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.jaeger-lecoultre.com/us-en/clocks/atmos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atmos Clock</a></li></ul>]]></description>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this episode, we delve into the concept of MCP (Machine Control Protocol) servers and their role in enabling agent interactions. Gil Feig, the co-founder and CTO of <a href="https://www.merge.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Merge</a>, shares insights on how MCP servers facilitate efficient and secure integration between various services and APIs.<br /><br />The discussion covers the benefits and challenges of using MCP servers, including their stateful nature, security considerations, and the importance of understanding real-world use cases. Gil emphasizes the need for thorough testing and evaluation to ensure that MCP servers effectively meet user needs.<br /><br />Additionally, we explore the implications of MCP servers on data security, scaling, and the evolving landscape of API interactions. Warren chimes in with experiences integrating AI with Auth. Will stuns us with some nuclear fission history. And finally, we also touch on the balance between short-term innovation and long-term stability in technology, reflecting on how different generations approach problem-solving and knowledge sharing.<br /><br />Picks<a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/mcp-servers-and-agent-interactions/#picks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">​</a>:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/survey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Adventures In DevOps: Survey</a></li><li>Warren: <a href="https://amzn.to/4o0lM55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Magicians by Lev Grossman</a></li><li>Gil: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Constant Escapement in Watchmaking</a></li><li>Will: <a href="https://amzn.to/42lsbQa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeon Crawler Carl</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.jaeger-lecoultre.com/us-en/clocks/atmos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atmos Clock</a></li></ul>]]></itunes:summary>

      <title>No Lag: Building the Future of High-Performance Cloud with Nathan Goulding</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/high-performance-cloud-edge-infrastructure-strategy</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Warren talks with Nathan Goulding, SVP of Engineering at <a href="https://www.vultr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vultr</a>, about what it actually takes to run a high-performance cloud platform. They cover everything from global game server latency and hybrid models to bare metal provisioning and the power/cooling constraints that come with modern GPU clusters.<br /><br />The discussion gets into real-world deployment challenges like scaling across 32 data centers, edge use cases that actually matter, and how to design systems for location-sensitive customers—whether that's due to regulation or performance.

      <description><![CDATA[Inna Tokarev Sela, CEO and founder of Illumex, joins the crew to break down what it really means to make your data “AI-ready.” This isn't just about clean tables—it's about semantic fabric, business ontologies, and grounding agents in your company's context to prevent the dreaded LLM hallucination.

      <description><![CDATA[Sylvain Kalache, Head of Developer Relations at <a href="https://labs.rootly.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rootly</a> joins us to explore the new frontier of incident response powered by large language models.

      <title>Decentralized Chaos: Web3 Infra, NodeOps, and the Art of Blockchain Load Balancing - DevOps 241</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/web3-is-going-great-with-infra-and-layers</link>
      <description><![CDATA[This week, Paul Marston from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ankr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ankr</a> joins the crew to unpack the madness that is modern blockchain infrastructure. From his wild career transition out of financial services into 24/7 node ops for Web3, Paul shares the brutal truth about uptime expectations, decentralization challenges, and why hard forks are more like enterprise schema upgrades with a community twist. If you've ever wondered why managing a blockchain node is like owning a temperamental pet server, this one's for you.<br /><br />The team goes deep on the nitty-gritty of load balancing across dozens of chains, explaining why routing traffic to the “wrong” archive node could ruin your day—and how Ankr's custom load balancer is basically magic for JSON-RPC calls. Warren tosses out wild scenarios about encrypted data smuggling via blockchain, while Will confesses his angry typing habit (yes, it's back). The discussion gets even more fun with debates on innovation vs. rigor, Web2's forgotten best practices, and why testing in prod might not be such a dirty word after all.<br /><br />But don't think it's all crypto and code. Paul shares battle-won wisdom from running over 100 chains across bare metal, giving us a peek at the operational sophistication and automation involved. From Terraform templates to Docker configs, he walks through the process of onboarding new chains and tuning for performance. The episode also touches on emerging risks like data exfiltration via public blockchains, and why AI (used wisely) might just be the sidekick DevOps always needed.<br /><br />And of course memes, we talk a bit about this one: <a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/assets/images/project-management-communication-meme-9abf814edad082236ced7ae2a8234633.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tree Swing Product Development</a><br /><br />Picks<a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/web3-is-going-great-with-infra-and-layers/#picks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">​</a><br /><ul><li>Warren: <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mk295-keyboard-mouse-combo.920-009782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dvorak Keyboard Setup and Logitech K295</a></li><li>Will: <a href="https://miniot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quirky Record Player from Miniot</a></li><li>Paul: <a href="https://superwhisper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Whisper - Voice Transcription Tool</a></li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>Observability in the CI/CD Pipeline with Adriana Villela - DevOps 240</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/everything-is-amazing-with-otel</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this episode, Will and Warren welcome Adriana Villela — CNCF ambassador, Dynatrace advocate, and host of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/geeking-out-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geeking Out podcast</a> — for a wide-ranging conversation on observability in CI/CD pipelines. Adriana shares her journey from “On Call Me Maybe” to her own podcast, her work with OpenTelemetry, and why observability isn't just for SREs anymore.<br /><br />The crew digs into how telemetry should be integrated across the software development lifecycle — from development to QA to production — and what that really looks like in modern teams.

She also explains how she got involved in the OpenTelemetry end-user SIG and what's next for the observability movement.<br /><br />Things get persona as we trade war stories about SVN, terrible version control systems, reusable grocery bags, and the ethics of AI log parsers.

      <title>Building Engineering Excellence with Ganesh Datta of Cortex - DevOps 239</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/internal-developer-portals-and-engineering-excellence</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this episode, I (flying solo today!) sat down with Ganesh Datta, the CTO and co-founder of Cortex, to explore what it really means to drive engineering excellence at scale. And spoiler: it's not just about better dashboards or fancy developer tools—it's about treating software development like the competitive advantage it is.<br /><br />We went deep into the why behind internal developer portals (IDPs) and how they're transforming platform engineering, developer experience, and organizational maturity. Ganesh shares how Cortex came to life—from being paged at 2am for a mystery Game of Thrones-named microservice (yep, we've all been there), to realizing that every other business function had a system of record—except engineering.<br /><br />Key Takeaways:<br /><ul><li>IDPs are like CRMs for Engineering: Just as sales teams wouldn't function without a CRM, modern engineering orgs shouldn't be flying blind without a structured, centralized developer portal.</li><li>Engineering Excellence = Business Outcomes: Whether it's reliability, security, or platform efficiency, IDPs help codify best practices and align teams toward measurable goals.</li><li>Start Small to Win Big: You don't need to overhaul everything on day one. Start with a pain point you already know—like production readiness—and improve that incrementally.</li><li>SREs and Platform Engineers Love IDPs: Because it gives them the data, ownership visibility, and real-time checks they need, without the honor-system chaos.</li><li>Developer Experience is Just the Beginning: Tools like Cortex aren't just about dev productivity—they're about creating resilient, aligned, scalable engineering orgs.</li></ul>We also geeked out about everything from naming services (“Brewer” for a feature extraction tool? Chef's kiss.) to the surprising power of reading 15 minutes before bed to improve sleep quality—yep, we went there!<br /><br />If you're part of an engineering team (or leading one) and want to know how to move faster and smarter, this is the episode for you.]]></description>

      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/are-ai-tools-making-us-smarter</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Is AI making us more productive? And where's the value? That's the big debate in this episode as we sit down with Zach Lloyd, founder and CEO of Warp. <a href="https://www.warp.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp</a> isn't just another terminal—it's an AI-powered reimagination of the command line. From replacing traditional terminal commands with English instructions to integrating AI-driven automation, Warp is pushing the boundaries of how we work. And finally we find out what Warren is using as a keyboard.<br /><br />In this episode, we discuss the evolution of AI in DevOps, whether LLMs are truly intelligent or just glorified word predictors, and the existential question: will developers eventually be replaced? Warren remains skeptical, questioning the real ROI of AI tools, while Jillian embraces the potential for more accessibility and efficiency—especially if it means she doesn't have to type. Will and Zach counter with insights on the actual adoption of AI among developers and where the technology is heading.<br /><br />As always, we wrap up with our Picks of the Episode, including an engaging sci-fi book, a thought-provoking AI philosophy experiment, a self-promotion plug, an academic research paper, and a medieval travel guide.

      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description>Enjoy this philosophical conversation around building code more responsibly and how ethics and accountability is to be integrated into the DevOps industry. Eric Tank joins the show and shares his perspective on how to “develop for deprecation”. Building a code that is documented, tested, monitored, and deployed is important, but can you easily pass it off to someone else, or be able to walk away from the code it entirely? Johnathan joins by saying that “software is never done until it's deleted.” They finish the discussion referencing apprenticeship models and how accountability in this way could parallel other industries.</description>

      <title>DevOps 018: How We Killed DevOps? with Adam Nowak</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this episode of Adventures in DevOps the pane interviews Adam Nowak. Adam is a part of the DevOps team at Netguru. He joins the panel today to share his DevOps transformation story. Adam starts by explaining the title he chose for today's episode. He also shares his definition of DevOps.Adam explains the age-old story of a misunderstood DevOps team that was overworked and underappreciated. The organization grew but the DevOps team didn't scale with it, leaving them with piles of tickets and everyone else wondering what was taking so long. The panel commiserates with Adam and shares some of their own similar stories. Reaching out to others to help solve the problem, Adam found that many DevOps teams had and are experiencing the same problem. He found help from others in the DevOps space and recommended books. His team started by making their work more visible. To do this they streamlined their communication and published documentation. Next, they made more focused goals. Instead of trying to do everything and never meeting their goals they chose a couple things to work on and focused on that. Another change they made was to diversify their meetings, projects, and initiatives; they brought in people from all the teams to collaborate, making the projects even better. The panel discusses the importance of empathy in the workplace and in life. Most people are trying their best and probably have a reason for doing the things that they are doing. Instead of treating others as if they are incompetent, talk them and discuss the reasons behind their actions and decisions. Panelists<ul><li>Nell Shamrell-Harrington</li><li>Charles Max Wood</li></ul>Guest<ul><li>Adam Nowak</li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>DevOps 017: Improving User Experience by Logging with Grant Schofield</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this episode Adventures in DevOps, the panel interviews Grant Schofield. Grant is Director of Infrastructure at Humio. He being by discussing the growth of logging and logging tools. Grant explains the business value of logging and analytics. He shares some real-life examples of how longing helped gain insight into the user experience. The panel wonders how Humio takes the data gathered in the logs and separate out specifics of user experience. Grant explains that by aggregating all data in one place Humio uses the logs, tracing and other metrics to draw conclusions about user experience. He shares some of the conclusions that can be drawn from that data and explains that the conclusions all depend on what you are looking for. The panel discusses how tracing traditionally works and asks Grant what process Humio uses to good sampling. Grant explains that sampling is a good way to save on costs and depends on how much indexing is taking place. He explains that knowing when to sample is very important if you want an accurate sample. Compliance concerns are the next topic the panel discusses with Grant. He explains what Humio does to remain compliant and keep user info safe and private. The panel moves on to discuss index-free logging. Grant explains how index-free logging works. He explains how fast it is and how easily clients can retrieve their data. Panelists<ul><li>Nell Shamrell-Harrington</li><li>Scott Nixon</li><li>Charles Max Wood</li></ul>Guest<ul><li>Grant Schofield</li></ul>]]></description>

      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this episode of Adventures in DevOps the panel interviews Oleg Chuninkin, CTO of Kublr. Oleg starts by explains what Kublr is all about and how he got the idea of using Kubernetes as an infrastructure abstraction. He and the Kublr team were trying to decide the most productive way to think of Kubernetes.   Oleg advocates for using Kubernetes locally and shares how you can then orchestrate your architecture so you can see what it will do in productions. Charles breaks down a few of the ideas Oleg shares. Oleg explains how the portability of Kubernetes can be used and shares recommendations with the panel on how to run a Kubernetes in a lightweight way.  The panel asks Oleg about the pressure for a cloud independent service and how these effects application requirements. Oleg shares some resources in answer. Moving on the panel considers Olegs comment about the layered architectural approach. Oleg outlines the layered architectural approach and explains what he means by layered. He explains the benefits of this approach. Panelists<ul><li>Scott Nixon</li><li>Charles Max Wood</li></ul>Guest<ul><li>Oleg Chunikin</li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>DevOps 015: Shiplane with John Epperson</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[This episode of Adventures in DevOps is joined by John Epperson. John is a developer and has worked in DevOps for his whole career spanning about 12 years. He is also the author of Shiplane. John made Shiplane after working with Docker for a while and getting fed up with some features not being as he wanted them to be. The panelists begin the discussion with going over John's talk “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”, where he covers three camps of developers namely pioneers, settlers, and townsfolk and the panelists go into detail about these camps. They also talk about how docker and Shiplane fit into this idea. John shares that Shiplane is a tool that converts docker-compose yaml files into production-ready docker deployments. John details more of how shiplane came about, the problems it solves, how it works, and how it helps users to cross knowledge barriers. He also shares how Shiplane provides customizability as it will give the user everything they need but lets them choose the pieces they want. The panelists also discuss what websites are running Shiplane as well as some of the support that Shiplane has. Currently it does not support Kubernetes but John is working on it. Chuck then asks John what the use case is for running Shiplane. They discuss specifically whether Shiplane is used locally, or as a SAAS service and why it is the way it is. Nell then asks John what his hopes are for the future of Shiplane. John would like to have Kubernetes capability added within a year. If someone wants to get involved with Shiplane they can do so by trying it out, reaching out to him on his discord server, and helping him find edge cases.  Panelists<ul><li>Nell Shamrell-Harrington</li><li>Scott Nixon</li><li>Charles Max Wood</li></ul>Guest<ul><li>John Epperson </li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>DevOps 014: Continuous Delivery With Julian Fahrer</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Julian Fahrer is a software engineer with a systems administration and operations background. He currently works at Hover and is helping them move towards continuous delivery. Nell opens up the discussion by asking Julian to explain what continuous integration and continuous delivery are. He shares that continuous integration revolves around having testing and automation around the code being pushed to ensure that it works and conforms to standards. Continuous delivery feeds off of the concept of continuous integration and is the ability to deploy to any environment at any point in time. Chuck puts these ideas together by saying that continuous delivery and continuous deployment is about making sure that it's possible to deploy at any time and actually doing so. The next topic covered by the Adventures in DevOps panelists is how to handle apprehension around having a continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Julian shares that big cultural changes are required to make CI/CD successful. They share that a lot of organizations are nervous about code with breaking changes immediately being deployed. One way to handle this vulnerability is by hiding features behind feature flags so that only certain people, for example the QA team, will have access to the feature.They share why an organization would want to change to a continuous delivery pipeline and some real world examples that they have experiencedChuck asks what some prerequisites are for a CI/CD pipeline. Scott says that one thing that needs to happen is backfilling areas of the application that previously did not have tests and expanding the testing coverage of the system. Julian shares that these prerequisites depend on how changes are made and shares some specific examples of what that entails. Nell asks what it takes for an organization to be able to do continuous delivery. Julian shares that it is mostly process driven. They establish some rules such as shortening the lifetime of development branches and improving how they are deployed. They also have a discussion on how integration tests should come about and who should write them. Julian mentions that you want to empower people and give them the tools they need to succeed. They then cover some of the work that Julian has done with Hover and some of the details of the continuous delivery environment he is building and the steps they took to begin moving towards that workflow.The topic then moves to dependency management. Nell asks Julian how he approached dependencies in his applications. Julian details how his usage of containers and specific tools helped him. For external environments he says that a database is required and that it would help to have standards for managing dependencies. They share how the current development culture is to give the QA team enough time to test a feature before it goes out. With a CI/CD environment, feature flags can be used to gradually roll out a changes and if a certain users needs a specific set of features then an individual environment can be spun up for their use case. The panelists share some thoughts on environments setup and production best practices and tooling. Panelists<ul><li>Nell Shamrell-Harrington</li><li>Charles Max Wood</li><li>Scott Nixon</li></ul> Guest<ul><li>Julian Fahrer</li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>DevOps 013: Application Monitoring Using RED With Dave McAllister</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[This episode of Adventures in Devops features Dave McAllister. Dave has an extensive background in open source starting in 1994 working with early versions of Linux. He thrives on the concepts of emerging technologies and being able to innovate things. He also loves understanding what people are doing with emerging technology. The discussion opens up by introducing the topic of multi-dimensional monitoring in RED. Dave gives us an introduction into RED as a subset of google's SRE Golden signals. RED stands for rate, errors, and durations and is a concept that is designed for working with micro services. The DevOps panelists discuss concepts such as saturation and how to ensure correct results from their micro services using the RED concepts as well as some best practices for managing micro services.  Nell asks about the scope of RED and whether it works with the big picture of what the micro service is doing. Dave shares that the scope of RED pertains to both. RED helps with observability and how to get the right signals out of all the noise and how to respond once the correct signals are found. He shares that RED should be a set of metrics in a dashboard that can be aggregated. He explains that RED gives the user a way of grouping data together and helping them to normalize functionality and find trends. The next topic covered by the DevOps experts is how to map the metrics seen in RED to the user experience. Dave explains how RED monitors the users activity and can put together metrics based on what they're doing. Using RED to follow user metrics will help to identify trends in where users will have issues and identify problem areas. Using micro services with RED introduces a level of granularity that can be monitored to help improve the performance of the application and improve scaling. RED helps with these improvements most notably by improving reaction time once a problem is found to help correct it as soon as possible. The panelists discuss some real world examples and how real world activities and human tendencies can alter patterns seen in the monitoring. Dave points out that one of the strongest recommendations he can make about RED is its ability to start simple and scale upwards as needed. The panelists then go on to discuss the human aspect of RED, how a team would react to changing, and how RED really requires a true DevOps team to reach its full potential. The panelists then share experiences they faced earlier in their careers as developers and how RED could have helped them. Nell brings up the idea of service meshes and how RED applies to them. Dave starts by introducing some problems in micro services and service meshes and the opportunity that exists for RED to come in and help solve those problems. He explains how service meshes in micro services give you duration that you don't have to implement. They finish with covering the usage of Kubernetes operators. Panelists<ul><li>Nell Shamrell-Harrington</li></ul> Guest<ul><li>Dave McAllister </li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>DevOps 012: Containerizing an Application</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[On this episode of Adventures in DevOps the panelists talk about how to containerize an app in a container using services such as Docker or Kubernetes. Charles mentions that he is wanting to host a Ruby on Rails application and Scott has experience with web deployments in Python and Django. They share that regardless of the languages and technologies used, the principles behind deploying a containerized application are the same.The next topic covered by the DevOps panelists is how to create containerized instances using Docker. The discussion centers on creating the container instances on a network and best practices that can be used for managing and maintaining them. The DevOps panelists cover the difference between an internal network deployment and what is needed to push a containerized application to a cloud instance using Kubernetes, Docker, DigitalOcean, or another service. Scott asks Charles if he is using a good CI/CD (continuous integration/ continuous delivery) mechanism, to which Charles shares that he is using Cloud 66 for its ease of use. When it comes to storage, they discuss whether to use the cloud services storage option or using a container to run a Postgres engine. They also go over the best way to run the shell commands for configuring their environment.The topic then moves to security and asset management when using Docker. Charles mentions that he tries to avoid putting API keys or other secrets into the Docker file and Scott shares how he uses a secrets management platform such as AWS Parameter Store, AWS Secrets Management, and others. They discuss the benefits that are provided by secrets management platforms. The DevOps panelists also talked about how a CI/CD platform can help with the portability of a containerized applicationCharles asks Scott how to begin with helping someone who wants to take their existing application and containerize it using the Docker approach. Scott responds with describing how he would look at where there application is and help them configure their containerized instance and set it up on a container service such as Docker or Kubernetes. Scott mentions that the strength of moving an application to a container service helps the application to scale up and down as needed. The container model helps a team to locally replicate their CI/CD model and be able to test it locally before the application is pushed to the cloud instance.The panelists talk about reverse proxies for pushing a Ruby on Rails app. Chuck prefers nginx and Scott emphasizes that it is important when pushing to production to spend some time verifying that the reverse proxy configuration is correct and won't expose the application in a way that it shouldn't be. Chuck shares that the use of a cloud platform such as GCP (Google Cloud Platform) of Microsoft Azure reduces the overhead with configuring containers and building images so that when he hands it off to the platform, it will take care of a large part of the setup including creation of the reverse proxy. Panelists<ul><li>Charles Max Wood</li><li>Scott Nixon</li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>DevOps 011: Let's Talk Agile</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this episode of the Adventures in DevOps podcast, the panelists talk about Agile. Nell starts the discussion by mentioning that Agile came out of the Scrum movement and gives a brief history of how it started. She reads out the Agile Manifesto, and Scott explains what it is. They agree that “move faster slowly” can be considered as a motto of Agile. Scott talks about the testing aspect of it from a philosophical perspective, and Nell chimes in with comparison to how things were being done in the past versus now.They discuss the 12 principles behind the Agile manifesto. One - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Two - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage, basically valuing learning and improvements.

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this episode of the Adventures in DevOps podcast, the panelists talk about Agile. Nell starts the discussion by mentioning that Agile came out of the Scrum movement and gives a brief history of how it started. She reads out the Agile Manifesto, and Scott explains what it is. They agree that “move faster slowly” can be considered as a motto of Agile. Scott talks about the testing aspect of it from a philosophical perspective, and Nell chimes in with comparison to how things were being done in the past versus now.They discuss the 12 principles behind the Agile manifesto. One - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Two - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage, basically valuing learning and improvements. Three - deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months with a preference for a shorter time scale, the focus being on the code being in a working state. Four - Business people and developers should collaborate daily through the project. Scott elaborates on the point further, and shares his experience where it was challenging to work with the business side of the project.Five - Build projects around motivated individuals, give them the support they need and trust them to get the job done, trust being the most important factor here.

      <title>DevOps 010: What Makes a 10x Engineer</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Episode Summary<br />On this week's Adventures in DevOps, Chuck talks about the recent Twitter thread about 10x engineers. He goes through each of the points in the tweet and talks about each of them in turn. There are only two points he sort of agrees with, and believes the rest to be absolute garbage. One of the issues with this tweet is that it doesn't define what a 10x engineer is.Defining a 10x engineer is difficult because it is also impossible to measure a truly average engineer because there are many factors that play into measuring productivity. Chuck turns the discussion to what a 10x engineer is to him and how to find one. A 10x engineer is dependent on the organization that they are a part of, because they are not simply found, they are made.When a 10x engineer is added to a team, the productivity of the entire team increases. Employers have to consider firstly what you need in your team and how a person would fit in. You want to avoid changing the entire culture of your organization. Consider also that a 10x engineer may be hired as a 2x engineer, but it is the employer that turns them into a 10x engineer.Overall, Chuck believes these tweets are asinine because it's impossible to measure what makes a 10x engineer in the first place, and hiring a person that fits the attributes in the list would be toxic to your company.Panel<ul><li>Charles Max Wood</li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>DevOps 009: Learning DevOps</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Episode Summary<br />In this episode of the Adventures in DevOps podcast, the panelists talk about getting started with DevOps and learning its principles and technologies. Lee and Scott mention that they share a similar journey, initially starting as system administrators and working their way into DevOps. Nell says that she was a Ruby and .NET developer before learning cloud technologies such as Heroku, Chef, and Docker.To someone with a programming background wanting to get into DevOps, Lee highly recommends three books - The Practice of System and Network Administration, The Practice of Cloud System Administration: DevOps and SRE Practices for Web Services - Volume 2, and Time Management for System Administrators. He mentions that they are technology-agnostic and help in understanding what is really going on in the system. Scott stresses on the importance of understanding basic networking, linux systems and commands, bash scripting and knowing the core fundamentals and interactions of the underlying systems. He suggests going for online resources, tutorials and boot camps which are plenty nowadays and easily accessible as well.Nell advises listeners to pick a cloud provider such as Digital Ocean and learn the basics by working with it, which can later be applied to any other cloud provider. She also recommends learning programming languages to get a good software development foundation. The panelists talk about working on specific projects and getting hands dirty rather than traditional learning, to enhance their DevOps skills.Nell explains how they implement the 'learning by doing' concept at work. She mentions that understanding how virtual machines and physical servers work is crucial before moving on to learning about containers. Lee suggests Vagrant - a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments, as a good resource for the same. They caution that while it is important to learn things during our time off, self-care and setting healthy boundaries is paramount. It is ok to take longer to learn something given that DevOps as a whole can be extremely complex, and working in a non-pressure environment can be very beneficial. They recommend Ops School for beginners which is a comprehensive program aimed at people who want to get into operations engineering.They then share their insights on monitoring and how to get started with it. Lee recommends the book Practical Monitoring, and Sensu - a monitoring event pipeline, as good starting points.DevOps can be considered as a technical as well as a cultural movement. To that effect, they discuss where should people start learning the associated cultural elements. Nell recommends reading the books - Effective DevOps, and The Phoenix Project and Crucial Conversations. Lee advocates going old school with the writings of Richard Stallman, and books of the 80s and 90s such as The Art of C Programming. They mention that conversational skills and dealing with people are critical skills in today's work environments. Scott recommends Google's Site Reliability Engineering books which have a lot of great stuff to build a solid foundation and are also free to read online.Finally, they talk about how to keep learning and expanding knowledge. Some effective suggestions discussed include extensive practicing, working professionally, solving business problems, building expertise in programming, and attending DevOps Days events and Linux Users groups. They end the episode with picks.Panel<ul><li>Nell Shamrell-Harrington</li><li>Lee Whalen</li><li>Scott Nixon</li></ul>]]></description>

      <title>DevOps 002: Castigated by Containers</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Panel<ul><li>Nell Shamrel-Harrington</li><li>Lee Waylin</li><li>Scott Nixon</li></ul>Episode Summary<br />Nell is a principal engineer at <a href="https://www.chef.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chef</a>, Lee runs the DevOps consulting team <a href="https://www.fuzzy-logic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fuzzy Logic Systems</a>, and Scott runs Cloud Mechanics consulting. The topic of today's podcast is containers. They begin by defining what a container is, with each sharing their own definition. Containers aren't really new, they're just a hot topic because companies like Docker made them easier to use and has brought them into the mainstream. The panelists agree that containers are not for storing data, only for running applications, but that data can be mounted to a container. This is one of the biggest beginner mistakes.  They discuss situations that are conducive to the proper use of containers. Containers are best added to mature and large scale projects. They discuss the pros and cons of Kubernetes. The panel gives advice on how to start using containers, suggesting new users start by containerizing one thing at a time rather than trying to do it all at once.

The topic of today's podcast is containers. They begin by defining what a container is, with each sharing their own definition. Containers aren't really new, they're just a hot topic because companies like Docker made them easier to use and has brought them into the mainstream. The panelists agree that containers are not for storing data, only for running applications, but that data can be mounted to a container. This is one of the biggest beginner mistakes.  They discuss situations that are conducive to the proper use of containers. Containers are best added to mature and large scale projects. They discuss the pros and cons of Kubernetes. The panel gives advice on how to start using containers, suggesting new users start by containerizing one thing at a time rather than trying to do it all at once. They remind listeners that if you want something to stick around for each deploy, it should not be in the container itself because containers are temporary. They talk about how to create a container, good patterns and anti-patterns found when using containers. They discuss possible security concerns with anti-patterns in containers. They finish by talking about other container orchestrators and how to get traffic to Docker boxes<br /><br />Links<ul><li><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker</a></li><li><a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Container</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LAMP</a> (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) </li><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.habitat.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Habitat.io</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@nirespire/what-is-cicd-concepts-in-continuous-integration-and-deployment-4fe3f6625007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CICD</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker Swarm</a></li><li><a href="http://mesos.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apache Mesos</a></li></ul> Picks<br />Nell Sharmell Harrington:<ul><li><a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/digin/post/ready-to-drink-cold-brew-coffee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trader Joe's Iced Coffee</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hbo.com/big-little-lies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Little Lies</a></li></ul>Lee Waylin:<ul><li><a href="https://www.magicsandbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic Sandbox</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4mQKTqf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall, or Dodge in Hell</a></li><li><a href="https://whisperroom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whisper Room</a></li></ul>Scott Nixon:<ul><li>  <a href="https://amzn.to/42WeWW3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Absolutely...]]></itunes:summary>

      <title>DevOps 003: The Tool Chain Crisis with Priyanka Sharma</title>
      <link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Panel<ul><li>Charles Max Wood</li><li>Lee Whalen</li><li>Scott Nixon</li></ul>Joined by Special Guest: Priyanka SharmaSummaryPriyanka Sharma gives an intro to the tool chain crisis; the panel shares their perspective on the crisis and where they see this problem. The panel considers how to solve this problem and Priyanka outlines a solution. She gives examples of how to start the data modeling process she believes will help solve this crisis along with suggesting guard rails for developers. The panel discusses this solution and considers how this will work in startups and smaller companies compared to well-established companies with their own tooling. Priyanka shares how to overcome the “we invented it here” syndrome. The panel considers how to choose the tools and the criteria to follow when considering tools.  The panel asks Priyanka about The Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Priyanka explains how it works and how projects are submitted and chosen. She shares where she thinks the DevOps industry is going and how the true promise of DevOps can only be reached by putting it in the hands of developers. The panel ends with a discussion on developer compensation problems, an increase of workloads and the benefits and need for remote work. 🎯 Picks:<br />Lee Whalen:<ul><li><a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/loadsharers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://www.catb.org/esr/loadsharers/</a></li><li><a href="http://boringtechnology.club/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://boringtechnology.club/</a>  </li></ul>Scott Nixon:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9Da3VsLH44" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Byron Cook, Amazon | AWS re:Inforce 2019</a>  </li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/</a>  </li></ul>Priyanka Sharma:<ul><li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/</a>  </li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6ZupYzr_Zg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keynote: Commercial Open Source Business Models - Sid Sijbrandij, Co-founder &amp; CEO, GitLab</a>  </li><li><a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub36356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub36356</a>  </li><li> Go Remote- <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/#resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/#resources</a>  </li></ul>Charles Max Wood:<ul><li>Air Conditioning</li><li><a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or</a>  </li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=instant-video&amp;k=expanse&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Expanse</a></li></ul>Special Guest: Priyanka Sharma .]]></description>
