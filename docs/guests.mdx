## 🏆 Our Current Guest Requests
We look for **expert technical practitioners**.

The way the podcast works is we focus on the topic area in which—you are the expert. The topic should be technical in nature and speak to our technical audience of DevOps practitioners. Focus on what's relevant relevant today, foundational challenges, and current or frequently occurring issues in your experience are great to share. Going into a case study-like review and getting into the details always turns into a great episode.

We're currently on the lookout for:

* **Staff+, Principal, and Scientist level Engineers** (with 8+ years of experience) who have a deep knowledge of a technical area that they are able to talk about.
* **Engineering Managers, Directors, Team Leads** who are **currently hiring**, what they are looking for, how they decide who to interview/how they interview/hire and have been responsible for hiring at multiple companies.
* **Engineering Heads, VPs, CTOs, and other technical leadership** with an **RTO policy** who can talk about what research they have done in productivity, remote work, etc.
* Engineering leaders who are currently **building ML as a service** and can talk about what they actually do from start to finish, (note: Not their product)
* Or really if you are a character and have an interesting perspective, then **Welcome!**.

## 📝 Not sure what to talk about?
Not a problem, for every episode we try to focus on one core topic area. So it's important to try to figure out what should be your episode topic. We use these questions to help inspire topics:

* Is there anything you are really passionately working on right now, or passionate about?
* Do you have something that you keep seeing people do wrong that you want to talk about?
* Is there a really hard problem your company/org/team is facing and there aren't good answers?
* Have you seen something happen with multiple companies/customers you have worked with that feels like it keeps happening?

## 🤫 I don't have a lot of public exposure

Also not a problem, we get guests that are long time public speakers and those that have never been on a stage. Our hosts will guide you through the episode, so there is nothing to worry about. And our editing team is top notch to make sure we can show the best side of you.

Not sure if this going to be a fit? Reach out to us anyone and we can help you make a decision.

## 📹 Episode Recording details

Guests should be prepared for shows with:
* **1 hour and 30 minutes**. We do a pre-show brief and a debrief after the show, and the extra time gives us flexibility in case there are any inevitable technology disruptions.
* Quality setup, a **quite place**, with sufficient lighting, where you can capture clear audio.
* As we record both audio and video, **the better the camera and microphone the better**, but if all you have are some earphones and a laptop mic we will make that work. Running air conditions, fans, and noisy outdoors do not work. Remember this is your episode, if the listeners can't hear you, then they can't hear what you have to say.
* Practical details about your technical work. **This is a technical podcast** with deep and interesting questions. We don't sit around and ask you how's the weather, we'll dive straight into the complex parts of the job, the work, the company, and your thoughts on the topics. You don't have to be technical, but you do need to be **Concrete** with the topics and stories you talk about.
** This is an **organic conversation**, there is no set agenda, and the goal is not ask hard questions, but instead provide thought provoking insight. This is a recorded conversation.
* A **Pick** - If you've watched or listened to the show, you know everyone is required to bring **exactly one Pick**, something that they are really interested by at this moment, be it a book, show, tool, adventure. We'll want to share a link to that thing. So if you love protein bars, we'll ask which protein bar is your favorite.
