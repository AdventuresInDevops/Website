# Get on the show!

## **This is your episode, so you get to \</rant> about whatever you want.**

We love your rants and want to hear it on our show. The Adventures in DevOps podcast, is all about getting your unique brand of insight into the world. The more controversial the idea, the better it is. **This is your opportunity to share.**

We've had quite the range of guests from [Distinguished Engineers from Google](/episodes/2024/10/10/balancing-technical-skills-in-high-stakes) reviewing the impact they had on Kubernetes to [Technology directors](/episodes/2024/09/26/mastermind-groups-are-transformative) sharing the importance of your technical and profession networks. We're almost at 300 [episodes](/episodes)!

## üèÜ Current Guest Requests
We look for **technical practitioners**.

The way the podcast works is we focus on the topic area in which‚Äîyou are the expert. The topic should be technical in nature and speak to our technical audience of DevOps practitioners. Focus on what's relevant relevant today, foundational challenges, and current or frequently occurring issues in your experience are great to share. Going into a case study-like review and getting into the details always turns into a great episode.

I will add the reminder, this is not an opportunity for you to advertise your product or brand, but provide real value where you want to. If you are interested in product placement, please see [our sponsorships](./sponsorship.mdx).

We're currently on the lookout for:
