Inna Tokarev Sela, CEO and founder of Illumex, joins the crew to break down what it really means to make your data “AI-ready.” This isn’t just about clean tables—it’s about semantic fabric, business ontologies, and grounding agents in your company's context to prevent the dreaded LLM hallucination. We dive into how modern enterprises just cannot build a single source of truth, not matter how hard they try. All the while knowing that it's required to build effected agents utilizing the available knowledge graphs and.

The conversation unpacks democratizing data access and avoiding analytics anarchy. Inna explains how automation and graph modeling are used to extract semantic meaning from disconnected data stores, and how to resolve conflicting definitions. And yes, Warren finally coughs up what's so wrong with most dashboards.

Lastly, we quickly get to the core philosophical questions of agentic systems and AGI, including why intuition is the real differentiator between humans and machines. Plus: storage cost regrets, spiritual journeys disguised as inference pipelines, and a very healthy fear of subscription-based sleep wearables.
