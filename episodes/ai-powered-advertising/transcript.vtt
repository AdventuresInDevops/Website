WEBVTT

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:02.267
Okay.

00:00:02.407 --> 00:00:03.229
And we're live.

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:04.649
Welcome back to another

00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:06.669
episode of Adventures in DevOps.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:07.629
I'm Warren Perod,

00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:09.510
one of your fellow co-hosts.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.231
And today in the studio,

00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:13.153
we're joined by Jillian yet again.

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:13.753
Hello, Jillian.

00:00:13.772 --> 00:00:13.893
Hello.

00:00:15.678 --> 00:00:17.618
And you can see that Will is absent today.

00:00:18.138 --> 00:00:19.359
I think he had some critical

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.519
problem yet again with his

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.019
infrastructure that he's managing.

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.501
But I'm looking forward to today's episode,

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.841
because we have with us as our guest,

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.821
Hikari Senju from Omnikey.

00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:34.482
HIKARI SENJU HIKARI SENJU Hello.

00:00:34.503 --> 00:00:34.682
Hey.

00:00:35.023 --> 00:00:36.262
So maybe you could just give

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.444
us a brief introduction

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:38.683
about your company,

00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:39.904
what it's sort of doing,

00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:41.365
and anything else

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:42.365
particularly interesting.

00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:44.063
Sure.

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:45.884
So my name is Hikaru Senju.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:47.786
I'm the founder and CEO of OmniKey.

00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:50.207
OmniKey uses data to

00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:51.448
generate more personalized

00:00:51.628 --> 00:00:52.829
ads and help businesses

00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:54.631
scale their advertising assets.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.411
So customers,

00:00:56.771 --> 00:00:58.052
oftentimes they're running

00:00:58.152 --> 00:00:58.753
ads on different

00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:00.054
advertising channels and

00:01:00.073 --> 00:01:00.994
they're looking to drive

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:02.875
efficiencies in their advertising.

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:05.177
And what we do is we'll

00:01:05.237 --> 00:01:06.158
train a model of the

00:01:06.177 --> 00:01:07.237
customer's brand information,

00:01:07.558 --> 00:01:08.959
we'll train on the

00:01:08.998 --> 00:01:10.078
customer's performance data,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.159
and then help them scale

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.820
their creative assets for a

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.460
variety of different

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.081
dimensions and SKUs to help

00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:19.222
them ultimately find ten X

00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:20.522
higher productivity in

00:01:20.543 --> 00:01:21.683
terms of their time,

00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:23.444
in terms of their cost and savings,

00:01:24.364 --> 00:01:25.204
and then ultimately in

00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:27.186
terms of the results.

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.046
Okay.

00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:30.888
That's a lot of things.

00:01:30.908 --> 00:01:31.987
Yeah.

00:01:33.018 --> 00:01:34.099
Yeah,

00:01:34.138 --> 00:01:36.239
we call ourselves the GenAI command

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.301
center for brands that are

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.320
looking to scale their

00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:40.201
digital advertising.

00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:43.784
So whether it's analytics or ideation,

00:01:44.483 --> 00:01:46.245
we really try to be that place,

00:01:46.265 --> 00:01:47.665
that control hub for

00:01:47.686 --> 00:01:49.027
customers to manage their

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:51.968
online advertising presence.

00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:53.149
What were they doing before

00:01:53.448 --> 00:01:55.129
AI stepped into this space?

00:01:56.727 --> 00:01:57.227
Well, gosh,

00:01:57.828 --> 00:01:59.471
AI has been in advertising for

00:01:59.772 --> 00:02:01.376
a long time.

00:02:01.396 --> 00:02:02.697
The personalized content

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.340
that you see recommended,

00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:09.033
like deep learning before it

00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:10.215
was used for generating

00:02:11.456 --> 00:02:14.080
images and copy and content

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.241
that you're seeing today

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.003
was used for targeting personalized ads.

00:02:18.123 --> 00:02:21.127
And so what we're doing is

00:02:21.147 --> 00:02:22.609
we're just taking the next step,

00:02:22.628 --> 00:02:23.651
which is instead of just

00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:24.972
personalizing the content

00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:25.552
delivered to you,

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:28.355
also personalizing the content itself.

00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:31.730
So before it was mostly

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:33.473
about when I see an ad on

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:35.414
say Facebook or LinkedIn or

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:36.896
on the top slot on Google,

00:02:37.176 --> 00:02:38.337
that content may have been

00:02:39.338 --> 00:02:40.600
using AI to generate the

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:43.644
actual words or pictures that I see,

00:02:43.683 --> 00:02:44.805
but you're utilizing it in

00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:46.247
a more novel way within the

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:46.967
product itself.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.973
So before it used to be, um,

00:02:51.993 --> 00:02:52.834
so there's the metric here

00:02:52.854 --> 00:02:53.594
is that forty percent of

00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:54.254
marketing projects are

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:55.656
wasted on ineffective content.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.198
So oftentimes you're getting retargeted,

00:02:58.818 --> 00:03:00.218
uh, with, you know, I'm sure we've,

00:03:00.278 --> 00:03:00.438
you know,

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.979
the audience's experience where

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.961
they're seeing the same ad

00:03:03.061 --> 00:03:05.282
over and over again, um, ad fatigue.

00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:09.224
Um, uh, there's the, uh, lack of,

00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:12.426
of like effective content being, uh,

00:03:12.447 --> 00:03:13.647
being bought and kind of

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:15.348
distributed online.

00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:18.969
Um, and what we too is, uh,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.710
when the content you see

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.191
that actually actually made or that,

00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:24.532
that video, um, that, that content itself,

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:25.133
uh,

00:03:25.212 --> 00:03:26.812
is personalized based on your

00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:28.253
interests and your needs.

00:03:28.653 --> 00:03:29.314
So it's not that you're

00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:31.915
seeing the same thing that, um, you know,

00:03:31.936 --> 00:03:33.417
that's kind of broadcasted

00:03:33.456 --> 00:03:34.037
everywhere else,

00:03:34.056 --> 00:03:35.016
but you're seeing a

00:03:35.097 --> 00:03:36.478
personalized piece of content.

00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:37.177
Um,

00:03:37.498 --> 00:03:38.818
that's personalized for just as much as

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:39.639
your newsfeed is

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.460
personalized for each day.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:41.688
Well,

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.032
I definitely don't think my newsfeed

00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:44.258
is personalized for me.

00:03:44.397 --> 00:03:45.060
I mean there's a lot of

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.962
things that show up there

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:48.090
that I really just couldn't care about.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.721
Yeah, I mean,

00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:51.200
I think it's still a work in progress.

00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:51.421
I mean,

00:03:51.782 --> 00:03:53.542
the algorithms are getting better

00:03:53.562 --> 00:03:53.921
every day.

00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:54.782
And it depends also on the

00:03:54.822 --> 00:03:55.663
platforms as well.

00:03:56.362 --> 00:03:59.163
But yeah, I mean,

00:04:00.144 --> 00:04:01.484
I think still there's the

00:04:01.524 --> 00:04:04.324
personalization we see in social apps.

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:05.745
And then there's the lack of

00:04:05.764 --> 00:04:06.384
personalization we're

00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:08.966
seeing when it comes to the

00:04:08.985 --> 00:04:09.705
content itself,

00:04:09.765 --> 00:04:11.086
the advertising content that you see.

00:04:11.546 --> 00:04:13.206
And so at the end of the day,

00:04:13.247 --> 00:04:14.467
if advertising content is

00:04:14.507 --> 00:04:15.788
more personalized and more effective,

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:19.250
at communicating what that

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.470
brand and that company is

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.110
trying to communicate,

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.012
if you can make that kind

00:04:23.031 --> 00:04:23.733
of connection with that

00:04:23.752 --> 00:04:27.254
consumer in a more productive way,

00:04:27.995 --> 00:04:29.336
then that's better for the

00:04:29.357 --> 00:04:30.237
consumer because I'm not

00:04:30.257 --> 00:04:31.379
being targeted at random ads,

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:32.399
I'm not seeing random ads,

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.740
and then ultimately it's

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:34.461
better for the business as

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.541
well because as a consumer,

00:04:36.562 --> 00:04:37.223
I'm seeing more relevant

00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:38.463
content and communicating

00:04:38.483 --> 00:04:39.805
in a way that I like.

00:04:40.464 --> 00:04:41.045
And for that business,

00:04:41.065 --> 00:04:42.646
it helps them with their sales.

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:45.199
So this is really

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:46.160
interesting because I think

00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:47.701
in advertising,

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.742
it seems like there's so

00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:49.862
many different angles that

00:04:49.903 --> 00:04:50.882
the AI could use.

00:04:50.903 --> 00:04:52.264
And I don't know a whole lot

00:04:52.283 --> 00:04:53.084
about advertising,

00:04:53.504 --> 00:04:54.906
but just kind of off the top of my head,

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:59.209
it seems like there's how

00:04:59.228 --> 00:05:00.670
the ad itself is being delivered.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.791
Is it on Google or Facebook or is it?

00:05:04.752 --> 00:05:06.074
Predominantly social platforms.

00:05:06.826 --> 00:05:08.708
yeah, which social platform it's on,

00:05:09.627 --> 00:05:11.307
the audience it's being shown to,

00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:13.129
you know, you have like age demographics.

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:14.930
I get a lot of teenage girl things,

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.649
which makes me wonder about

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:18.471
the algorithms a little bit,

00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:19.511
but that's because I have a

00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:20.130
teenage daughter.

00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:21.951
And then there's also like

00:05:21.992 --> 00:05:23.252
the ad copy itself.

00:05:23.312 --> 00:05:25.432
So does your product help

00:05:25.673 --> 00:05:26.812
with all of those things or

00:05:26.872 --> 00:05:28.314
one of those things or like

00:05:28.334 --> 00:05:29.173
what is going on there?

00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:31.435
Yeah, it focuses on the visuals.

00:05:31.774 --> 00:05:33.838
So the images and the video

00:05:33.877 --> 00:05:34.738
content that you're seeing,

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:36.680
that's what we specialize in.

00:05:37.762 --> 00:05:39.024
Okay, okay, that's interesting.

00:05:39.103 --> 00:05:40.685
I didn't notice like a few years ago,

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:43.189
or I don't even know when,

00:05:43.348 --> 00:05:44.470
but I noticed with Google,

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:45.310
it started to have,

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.291
Google Ads started to have

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:47.394
this new feature where

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.942
They were like,

00:05:50.002 --> 00:05:50.742
we'll just train it and

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:51.923
figure out where it should be.

00:05:51.963 --> 00:05:53.406
You just give us the ad copy,

00:05:53.485 --> 00:05:54.906
and then we'll go send it out.

00:05:54.927 --> 00:05:55.827
So it seems like you're on

00:05:55.848 --> 00:05:56.668
the other side of that.

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:57.110
We're like, no,

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.930
we're going to generate the

00:05:57.971 --> 00:05:59.992
actual ad for you,

00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:02.656
and then somebody else can distribute it.

00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:02.956
Yeah, I mean,

00:06:02.976 --> 00:06:03.798
Google has been definitely

00:06:03.817 --> 00:06:04.738
innovator in this space.

00:06:08.754 --> 00:06:09.295
be like,

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:10.576
we're going to actually limit how

00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:11.255
much control you have in

00:06:11.276 --> 00:06:11.855
terms of content.

00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:13.096
You just give us your assets,

00:06:13.257 --> 00:06:13.916
and then we'll kind of mix

00:06:13.937 --> 00:06:14.737
and match for you.

00:06:16.317 --> 00:06:18.177
What we're trying to do is that,

00:06:18.218 --> 00:06:20.718
but for social posts and

00:06:20.978 --> 00:06:22.079
content you're seeing on YouTube,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.500
and also to make sure that

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:24.940
the content is consistent

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.521
in an omnichannel way so

00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:28.041
that when a consumer sees an ad on Google,

00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:29.523
it is consistent with the

00:06:29.603 --> 00:06:32.384
ad they're seeing on Reddit or LinkedIn.

00:06:33.952 --> 00:06:34.552
Because, you know,

00:06:34.653 --> 00:06:35.834
if Google is kind of

00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:36.935
communicating your brand one way,

00:06:36.975 --> 00:06:37.375
but rather it's

00:06:37.394 --> 00:06:38.295
communicating brand a different way,

00:06:38.336 --> 00:06:39.237
then it's not very,

00:06:39.617 --> 00:06:40.458
it doesn't elevate the

00:06:40.838 --> 00:06:41.557
brand experience and it

00:06:41.577 --> 00:06:42.838
doesn't create brand consistency.

00:06:42.918 --> 00:06:45.500
And so ultimately this is

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.661
really where managing your

00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:47.663
brand online is so

00:06:47.702 --> 00:06:49.363
important is that you don't, you know,

00:06:49.384 --> 00:06:50.824
you don't delegate the

00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:51.925
creation of your brand or

00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:53.127
the imagery of your brand

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:54.867
to each platform,

00:06:54.887 --> 00:06:55.728
but you really can

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:57.009
orchestrate that brand

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:00.232
messaging yourself in our control hub.

00:07:01.913 --> 00:07:03.576
Interesting how so I think

00:07:03.636 --> 00:07:04.536
one of the things that

00:07:04.615 --> 00:07:05.416
advertisements have

00:07:05.536 --> 00:07:06.458
struggled for the longest

00:07:06.478 --> 00:07:07.538
time at least from my

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:09.540
perspective is Adequate

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.062
personalization more so

00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:12.603
than just like hello,

00:07:12.884 --> 00:07:14.545
you know templated name and

00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:16.307
then generic repeatable

00:07:16.367 --> 00:07:18.908
message in the body Or an

00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:20.250
image that isn't very

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.833
personalized How how are you?

00:07:23.452 --> 00:07:25.574
getting over that hump like

00:07:25.615 --> 00:07:26.716
if the data wasn't ever

00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:27.776
good in the first place

00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:28.978
like you are you getting

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:30.100
better data now to be able

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.961
to generate personalized uh

00:07:32.182 --> 00:07:35.225
content uh or is it that we

00:07:35.285 --> 00:07:36.625
had the data all like the

00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:37.906
whole time and we just

00:07:37.947 --> 00:07:38.507
weren't using it

00:07:38.548 --> 00:07:40.089
effectively does that make

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.011
sense yeah I mean there's

00:07:42.031 --> 00:07:43.173
an element where these

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:44.314
platforms like they for

00:07:44.334 --> 00:07:44.973
example they could

00:07:46.158 --> 00:07:47.079
You could actually run ads

00:07:47.098 --> 00:07:49.521
like this where it's, you know, hello,

00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:51.723
Warren, buy X product.

00:07:53.043 --> 00:07:54.704
But it would be too creepy

00:07:55.045 --> 00:07:55.725
and it would actually

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:58.067
result in you leaving the platform.

00:07:58.447 --> 00:07:59.829
And so they intentionally don't,

00:08:01.038 --> 00:08:02.800
allow advertisers to do things like that.

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:04.021
And they'll ban advertisers

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.841
to do things like this.

00:08:05.422 --> 00:08:07.023
Um, because the platforms themselves,

00:08:07.524 --> 00:08:09.625
you know, they're trying to, um, you know,

00:08:09.665 --> 00:08:10.505
maximize the engagement of

00:08:10.526 --> 00:08:11.146
the platform and they're

00:08:11.166 --> 00:08:12.487
not trying to creep out their users and,

00:08:12.807 --> 00:08:12.968
you know,

00:08:12.987 --> 00:08:13.908
make it seem like they know more

00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:14.970
than they need to.

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:17.031
And so, um, um,

00:08:17.052 --> 00:08:17.851
there's an element where I think,

00:08:18.273 --> 00:08:18.452
you know,

00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:21.826
like that creepiness factor, you know, uh,

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:23.108
pushes, is,

00:08:23.187 --> 00:08:24.488
is it kind of a pushback

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:26.930
against like hyper, hyper,

00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:27.831
hyper personalization?

00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:28.932
Um, and then,

00:08:28.992 --> 00:08:30.093
and then I think the other

00:08:30.113 --> 00:08:30.593
thing here though,

00:08:30.653 --> 00:08:32.155
is it's also just creative bandwidth.

00:08:32.696 --> 00:08:34.677
Um, you know, if you are, uh, you know,

00:08:35.057 --> 00:08:36.239
brand and you have you know

00:08:36.278 --> 00:08:37.379
I mean this is you know

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.921
even even even like the the

00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:40.062
biggest brands in the world

00:08:40.903 --> 00:08:41.683
they may have thousands of

00:08:41.744 --> 00:08:43.946
skews creating content for

00:08:43.966 --> 00:08:46.587
thousands of skews across

00:08:46.607 --> 00:08:47.609
you know in every single

00:08:48.129 --> 00:08:48.809
platform requires a

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.770
different ad format so meta

00:08:50.971 --> 00:08:52.753
instagram reddit linkedin

00:08:53.192 --> 00:08:55.095
snap you know etc etc they

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:57.017
all require you know videos

00:08:57.096 --> 00:08:58.498
or like horizontal or

00:08:59.096 --> 00:09:01.116
vertical content in different dimensions.

00:09:01.697 --> 00:09:03.476
And so it's just a lot of

00:09:03.517 --> 00:09:05.857
work to create all that content.

00:09:05.957 --> 00:09:09.558
And today,

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:11.340
a designer is hired to do those things.

00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:14.519
So that's really where automation comes in,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.260
is that an AI can

00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:16.140
automatically create all

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.120
those variations for all

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.020
those SKUs for you.

00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:18.802
So in our platform,

00:09:18.822 --> 00:09:20.741
customers can just upload

00:09:20.782 --> 00:09:21.761
all their product assets,

00:09:22.102 --> 00:09:22.682
and it will create all the

00:09:22.702 --> 00:09:23.363
variations for you.

00:09:24.794 --> 00:09:26.196
A-B testing and inserting

00:09:26.216 --> 00:09:27.998
different product skews and

00:09:28.018 --> 00:09:28.717
also creating different

00:09:28.758 --> 00:09:30.340
output variations and dimensions.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.001
I see.

00:09:33.162 --> 00:09:33.962
That makes a lot of sense.

00:09:34.003 --> 00:09:36.004
So you're utilizing the

00:09:36.105 --> 00:09:37.505
filters or tags or

00:09:37.566 --> 00:09:39.368
attributes that your

00:09:39.408 --> 00:09:40.849
customer already has and

00:09:40.948 --> 00:09:41.509
how they're already

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.711
personalizing or segmenting

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.211
the market and using that

00:09:44.572 --> 00:09:46.274
to feed into a model to

00:09:46.313 --> 00:09:47.695
generate the images based off of

00:09:48.014 --> 00:09:49.076
well maybe each of their

00:09:49.115 --> 00:09:50.297
products whereas before if

00:09:50.397 --> 00:09:51.977
I'm like the one of the

00:09:52.018 --> 00:09:53.559
largest running shoe

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.841
manufacturers in the world

00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:56.942
I may just have one ad with

00:09:56.982 --> 00:09:58.524
just one shoe in it or

00:09:58.563 --> 00:09:59.124
maybe I have a couple

00:09:59.163 --> 00:10:00.125
different runners so I have

00:10:00.525 --> 00:10:01.466
a couple of different shoes

00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:03.128
but I can't have the same

00:10:03.148 --> 00:10:04.849
video with literally every

00:10:04.869 --> 00:10:06.330
single kind of shoe hyper

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:08.812
targeted to some set of the

00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:10.813
market where would be more

00:10:10.894 --> 00:10:12.095
interested in that

00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:13.655
particular shoe whether it's hiking shoes

00:10:14.573 --> 00:10:15.455
That's exactly right.

00:10:15.534 --> 00:10:16.196
So this is really where

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:18.577
generated AI comes in so handy,

00:10:18.658 --> 00:10:19.979
is because what we do is we

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:21.821
can train a model on each product,

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.662
on each shoe,

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:24.443
and then generate images and videos.

00:10:24.903 --> 00:10:25.605
And I'm sure we're seeing

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.447
this all online now of

00:10:27.527 --> 00:10:28.687
people wearing those shoes

00:10:28.727 --> 00:10:29.649
and those variations.

00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:33.472
And we can do it very cheaply.

00:10:35.153 --> 00:10:35.474
sets,

00:10:35.734 --> 00:10:38.375
generate those collateral assets with

00:10:38.394 --> 00:10:39.235
cents instead of the

00:10:39.796 --> 00:10:40.816
thousands or tens of

00:10:40.855 --> 00:10:41.496
thousands of dollars

00:10:41.897 --> 00:10:43.136
historically required to do

00:10:43.157 --> 00:10:43.998
a photo shoot like that or

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:44.837
a video shoot like that.

00:10:45.317 --> 00:10:47.499
And so we empower

00:10:47.538 --> 00:10:48.320
personalization and we

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.200
increase personalization by

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.801
lowering the cost of

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.780
creating content and

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.162
lowering the cost of advertising.

00:10:54.702 --> 00:10:55.744
So that big enterprise,

00:10:55.803 --> 00:10:57.085
but also small businesses too.

00:10:59.307 --> 00:10:59.947
By lowering the cost of

00:10:59.967 --> 00:11:00.768
advertising and lowering

00:11:00.807 --> 00:11:01.149
the cost of trade,

00:11:01.168 --> 00:11:01.869
we also empower small

00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:02.789
businesses to historically

00:11:02.809 --> 00:11:04.471
wouldn't advertise or

00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:06.754
wouldn't advertise a lot to

00:11:06.793 --> 00:11:07.754
be able to do this.

00:11:07.774 --> 00:11:09.076
And I think there's been

00:11:10.096 --> 00:11:11.378
kind of a barrier to entry

00:11:11.398 --> 00:11:12.078
in some ways for

00:11:12.158 --> 00:11:16.043
advertising because how expensive it is.

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:19.726
But by lowering the cost of advertising,

00:11:19.767 --> 00:11:20.388
you're empowering more

00:11:20.427 --> 00:11:22.529
businesses to be able to advertise sooner,

00:11:22.669 --> 00:11:23.791
connect with their customers sooner,

00:11:24.932 --> 00:11:26.354
which is kind of our

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:27.596
mission to democratize growth.

00:11:32.754 --> 00:11:34.115
One of the biggest costs I

00:11:34.135 --> 00:11:34.996
was always under the

00:11:35.017 --> 00:11:36.258
impression of was actually

00:11:36.298 --> 00:11:37.958
getting the content out,

00:11:37.999 --> 00:11:39.500
like not necessarily creating the content,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.642
but once you have it,

00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:42.442
actually paying to get it

00:11:42.482 --> 00:11:44.144
in front of the right audience.

00:11:44.524 --> 00:11:45.966
And you're not necessarily changing that.

00:11:45.985 --> 00:11:47.047
You're just lowering the...

00:11:49.128 --> 00:11:52.210
entry for the content generation side?

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:52.990
Or is there something you're

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.892
also doing for actually

00:11:55.052 --> 00:11:56.113
getting those clicks at a

00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:57.754
cheaper volume per price?

00:11:57.815 --> 00:11:58.014
Yeah.

00:11:58.434 --> 00:11:59.956
So that's where we're this

00:11:59.975 --> 00:12:00.876
is really where agentic

00:12:01.636 --> 00:12:03.958
agentic stuff we're

00:12:03.979 --> 00:12:05.259
building really comes into play.

00:12:06.962 --> 00:12:08.583
today and we offer this both

00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:09.725
as a service and and kind

00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:11.245
of and we're building this

00:12:11.287 --> 00:12:12.687
out in terms of an agenting

00:12:12.727 --> 00:12:16.149
platform but um uh you know

00:12:16.471 --> 00:12:17.390
as a service I mean today

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.491
you have something you know

00:12:18.511 --> 00:12:19.413
you have an advert you have

00:12:19.432 --> 00:12:21.375
a person who goes and buys

00:12:21.394 --> 00:12:23.655
the ad on meta google and

00:12:23.856 --> 00:12:26.259
linkedin and adjust the

00:12:26.298 --> 00:12:27.359
bids or adjust the

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:30.341
targeting audience kind of

00:12:30.361 --> 00:12:31.403
do that manually by hand

00:12:33.327 --> 00:12:36.068
Maybe this year you'll have an agent,

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:38.990
an AI agent do that for you

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.950
instead of a person.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.051
So an AI agent will go and

00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:45.231
measure the click through rates,

00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:45.692
for example,

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:48.312
for every single platform or the ROI,

00:12:48.552 --> 00:12:49.613
how much revenue is being

00:12:49.653 --> 00:12:50.594
generated in terms of sales

00:12:50.614 --> 00:12:51.413
from each advertising

00:12:51.433 --> 00:12:52.714
platform and then adjust

00:12:52.734 --> 00:12:54.115
the bids and adjust the audiences

00:12:54.855 --> 00:12:56.857
autonomously, you know, twenty four seven.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.701
And, you know, again,

00:13:00.123 --> 00:13:01.163
at a fraction of the cost

00:13:01.644 --> 00:13:03.687
of of a person doing and

00:13:03.888 --> 00:13:04.808
working twenty four seven.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:10.157
And so that is also an area

00:13:10.177 --> 00:13:10.817
that we're innovating in.

00:13:12.734 --> 00:13:14.115
OK, that's really cool.

00:13:14.134 --> 00:13:15.836
You did talk about training a lot.

00:13:15.897 --> 00:13:16.577
Maybe I want to get into

00:13:16.597 --> 00:13:17.158
that a little bit.

00:13:17.619 --> 00:13:18.639
I assume you're not building

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.482
up new foundational models

00:13:21.663 --> 00:13:22.724
and maybe utilizing

00:13:22.764 --> 00:13:23.423
something that that's

00:13:23.465 --> 00:13:24.345
already out there and

00:13:24.365 --> 00:13:26.868
either fine tuning it or building.

00:13:27.347 --> 00:13:28.990
Are you building something from scratch?

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:29.890
Like, what does that look like?

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.662
Yeah, I mean,

00:13:34.102 --> 00:13:34.783
we describe ourselves as kind

00:13:34.803 --> 00:13:35.845
of a mixture of experts.

00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:38.366
So we take the best models

00:13:38.386 --> 00:13:39.947
in different domains and

00:13:40.128 --> 00:13:41.269
utilize it to help our

00:13:41.308 --> 00:13:42.490
customers deliver some kind

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.431
of a solution.

00:13:43.892 --> 00:13:46.394
So for us, for image,

00:13:46.413 --> 00:13:48.395
like hyper-realistic photo generation,

00:13:48.436 --> 00:13:52.278
we do fine tune on a pre-existing model.

00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:55.341
For us, we fine tune on images.

00:13:55.741 --> 00:13:57.283
uh as of today you know this

00:13:57.322 --> 00:13:58.624
may change you know as

00:13:58.644 --> 00:13:59.985
these models advance but uh

00:14:00.024 --> 00:14:01.365
today it's a it's like a

00:14:01.946 --> 00:14:03.346
flux model by black forest

00:14:03.407 --> 00:14:06.208
labs um and uh and that's

00:14:06.229 --> 00:14:06.869
how we generate hyper

00:14:06.908 --> 00:14:08.409
realistic imagery and then

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:09.091
we use different model turn

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.371
that into video uh we use

00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:12.052
different model for you

00:14:12.072 --> 00:14:13.614
know predominantly open ai

00:14:13.634 --> 00:14:16.375
models for uh generating

00:14:16.394 --> 00:14:20.057
copy and creative briefs and uh

00:14:21.265 --> 00:14:22.466
and tagging the ads.

00:14:22.827 --> 00:14:23.307
Well,

00:14:23.327 --> 00:14:25.450
we have an AI go and tag every image

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.912
and video in terms of the

00:14:26.971 --> 00:14:28.552
elements of that creative

00:14:29.693 --> 00:14:30.595
in a more deeper way than

00:14:30.634 --> 00:14:31.515
just computer vision.

00:14:31.535 --> 00:14:36.500
So our first version of the

00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:37.942
analytics where there's computer vision,

00:14:38.101 --> 00:14:40.625
cat, dog, maybe cat drives more clicks.

00:14:41.785 --> 00:14:43.067
Now you can have AI

00:14:44.474 --> 00:14:46.596
explain the image in a much more nuanced,

00:14:46.796 --> 00:14:47.235
deep way.

00:14:47.255 --> 00:14:50.158
What is the persuasion tactic being used?

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.881
What is the use of language, et cetera?

00:14:54.902 --> 00:14:57.364
And what kind of imagery is it in?

00:14:57.403 --> 00:14:58.325
And then we can turn those

00:14:58.345 --> 00:14:59.544
into creative features that

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:01.647
we can then find trends in

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.048
terms of what's driving

00:15:03.067 --> 00:15:03.869
more engagement or driving

00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:05.250
more clicks and communicate

00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.850
that to our customers.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.113
So we're using different

00:15:09.133 --> 00:15:09.932
kinds of AI depending on

00:15:10.774 --> 00:15:11.794
what part of the workflow

00:15:12.634 --> 00:15:13.316
that's being automated.

00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:16.437
Okay, that's really interesting.

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:18.649
I'm wondering, do you have some type of

00:15:20.171 --> 00:15:20.490
I don't know,

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:21.851
the only word that I can think of it is,

00:15:21.932 --> 00:15:22.131
you know,

00:15:22.152 --> 00:15:23.552
like some kind of boutique experience.

00:15:23.572 --> 00:15:24.192
So for example,

00:15:24.253 --> 00:15:26.033
I was on Amazon buying

00:15:26.293 --> 00:15:27.754
something and I noticed the

00:15:27.933 --> 00:15:28.673
pictures there,

00:15:28.754 --> 00:15:29.235
there was like two

00:15:29.254 --> 00:15:30.115
different products that had

00:15:30.154 --> 00:15:31.414
the exact same pictures.

00:15:31.434 --> 00:15:32.176
And they looked like,

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.255
I don't know if it was like

00:15:33.275 --> 00:15:34.056
stock photography,

00:15:34.076 --> 00:15:35.697
or then they just switched out.

00:15:35.716 --> 00:15:36.437
It was like leggings,

00:15:36.456 --> 00:15:37.597
they switched out the pairs

00:15:37.618 --> 00:15:38.298
of leggings or not.

00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:39.317
But I was immediately like,

00:15:39.798 --> 00:15:40.678
I don't know what this is.

00:15:40.798 --> 00:15:41.778
I don't know if this is fake.

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:43.139
I don't know if this is a real product.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.159
And I clicked right out.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:44.860
So I'm wondering, like,

00:15:44.941 --> 00:15:45.921
is there some type of

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.182
safeguard to make sure that

00:15:48.601 --> 00:15:49.702
everybody who has a pair of

00:15:49.763 --> 00:15:50.822
shoes is not getting the

00:15:50.923 --> 00:15:52.024
exact same image or even

00:15:52.563 --> 00:15:53.945
very close to the same image?

00:15:54.264 --> 00:15:55.105
How do you even measure

00:15:55.145 --> 00:15:55.826
something like that?

00:15:55.865 --> 00:15:57.047
How does all of that work?

00:15:58.136 --> 00:15:58.476
Sure.

00:15:58.496 --> 00:15:59.758
So Amazon's interesting

00:15:59.798 --> 00:16:01.259
because a lot of their ads

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:01.919
are just straight up

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.621
product photos from the catalog,

00:16:03.642 --> 00:16:04.501
from the product catalog.

00:16:04.542 --> 00:16:06.344
And so,

00:16:06.403 --> 00:16:07.184
and oftentimes you're just being

00:16:07.205 --> 00:16:07.985
targeted at those product

00:16:08.004 --> 00:16:09.966
photos and using the same product,

00:16:09.986 --> 00:16:11.808
but maybe it's like, you know, this is,

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:12.528
I don't know if there was

00:16:12.548 --> 00:16:13.129
two different companies or

00:16:13.149 --> 00:16:13.789
it was the same company,

00:16:13.809 --> 00:16:14.750
maybe it's two different companies,

00:16:15.652 --> 00:16:17.033
like reselling the same thing.

00:16:17.052 --> 00:16:17.734
Yeah, I don't know.

00:16:17.754 --> 00:16:18.855
That's why I clicked off of it.

00:16:18.875 --> 00:16:20.216
I was like, I'm not going to do that.

00:16:20.255 --> 00:16:21.157
I'm going to go buy

00:16:21.177 --> 00:16:22.577
something that looks like a real product.

00:16:23.327 --> 00:16:24.288
Right, right, right, right.

00:16:24.369 --> 00:16:25.028
And maybe, who knows,

00:16:25.048 --> 00:16:25.690
maybe they both got the

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:26.129
same image of the

00:16:26.149 --> 00:16:27.150
manufacturer or something, right?

00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:28.672
And they were advertising with you.

00:16:28.751 --> 00:16:29.793
And just Amazon knew that

00:16:29.852 --> 00:16:30.874
maybe you thought that you

00:16:30.894 --> 00:16:31.715
were in the market for this

00:16:31.735 --> 00:16:34.376
kind of product.

00:16:34.397 --> 00:16:35.177
We do have controls.

00:16:35.216 --> 00:16:36.717
And so we do have a human in

00:16:36.738 --> 00:16:37.938
the loop to really make

00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.080
sure that the content

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.982
that's being generated is IP protective,

00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:44.625
so it's not infringing on

00:16:44.924 --> 00:16:45.705
anyone's copyright.

00:16:48.047 --> 00:16:50.690
that it is brand safe,

00:16:51.331 --> 00:16:52.451
that it is aligned with brand guidelines.

00:16:52.471 --> 00:16:53.452
We actually have a separate model.

00:16:54.073 --> 00:16:55.576
When we train our language model,

00:16:56.697 --> 00:16:59.179
we train it on the brand

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.801
guidelines of the customer.

00:17:00.922 --> 00:17:02.844
So we're generating content

00:17:03.083 --> 00:17:04.345
that aligns with the

00:17:04.365 --> 00:17:05.846
restrictions of that brand

00:17:05.987 --> 00:17:07.087
within their brand guidelines.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:09.471
and then we also have a

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:10.832
human loop so both at the

00:17:10.872 --> 00:17:12.034
kind of inception training

00:17:12.153 --> 00:17:12.994
of the model we train on

00:17:13.015 --> 00:17:14.195
the brand and then the very

00:17:14.215 --> 00:17:16.617
kind of uh human review

00:17:16.657 --> 00:17:20.561
step uh we have um uh you

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:22.223
know make sure that the

00:17:22.364 --> 00:17:23.525
there's no ip being

00:17:23.545 --> 00:17:24.405
violated or there's no

00:17:24.465 --> 00:17:27.288
brand uh principle that's being violated

00:17:28.294 --> 00:17:29.295
Yeah, because fundamentally,

00:17:29.375 --> 00:17:30.395
it's still on your

00:17:30.496 --> 00:17:32.156
customers to validate the

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:32.877
content that they're

00:17:32.938 --> 00:17:34.659
putting out is in line with

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:35.680
what they actually want.

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:36.601
I mean, obviously,

00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:37.641
you can assume that at a

00:17:38.142 --> 00:17:39.583
giant amount of assets,

00:17:39.623 --> 00:17:40.503
you no longer can have

00:17:40.544 --> 00:17:41.344
someone individually

00:17:41.403 --> 00:17:42.204
reviewing everything.

00:17:42.244 --> 00:17:43.405
So you must have things in place

00:17:43.746 --> 00:17:44.886
to help cut down on that I

00:17:44.926 --> 00:17:46.467
think the custom trainings

00:17:46.507 --> 00:17:48.428
custom models um you know

00:17:48.489 --> 00:17:50.609
multi-step evaluations uh

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.611
two-shot uh you know helps

00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:53.730
a lot but fundamentally the

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:54.332
customer is still

00:17:54.832 --> 00:17:56.071
responsible for and

00:17:56.092 --> 00:17:57.012
probably wants to validate

00:17:57.053 --> 00:17:57.752
that what they're getting

00:17:57.853 --> 00:17:59.953
out is actually uh accurate

00:18:00.555 --> 00:18:01.214
yeah absolutely so there's

00:18:01.234 --> 00:18:01.815
a we have a we actually

00:18:01.835 --> 00:18:02.955
have an uh approval

00:18:02.976 --> 00:18:03.435
dashboard where the

00:18:03.455 --> 00:18:03.955
customers can write

00:18:03.976 --> 00:18:05.856
feedback uh to the platform

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:06.698
in terms of this is not

00:18:06.738 --> 00:18:08.499
right or this is right and um

00:18:09.807 --> 00:18:10.367
So we built this whole

00:18:10.387 --> 00:18:13.589
workflow for review as well,

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.570
because I think a large

00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:18.815
part of AI going forward as

00:18:18.855 --> 00:18:20.576
well in different parts of

00:18:22.417 --> 00:18:23.199
the workflow is going to be

00:18:23.578 --> 00:18:24.500
some level of human review.

00:18:25.901 --> 00:18:26.561
I don't think anyone,

00:18:28.403 --> 00:18:31.385
even as we give AI more control,

00:18:31.766 --> 00:18:33.548
there's going to be

00:18:33.587 --> 00:18:35.930
safeguards in place for human review.

00:18:38.208 --> 00:18:39.489
Yeah, it's really about how do you,

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.990
you know,

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.571
like build a tool where it used

00:18:42.612 --> 00:18:44.173
to be that a human is doing

00:18:44.213 --> 00:18:45.414
all the work and now human

00:18:45.454 --> 00:18:46.615
is largely just babysitting

00:18:46.635 --> 00:18:48.337
an algorithm to do the work for you.

00:18:48.778 --> 00:18:49.419
And what are the review

00:18:49.459 --> 00:18:51.121
steps you put in so that a

00:18:51.141 --> 00:18:51.580
human can do that

00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:53.462
effectively and get consistent,

00:18:53.482 --> 00:18:54.023
get good results.

00:18:54.997 --> 00:18:55.156
I mean,

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:56.657
I think one of the challenges is

00:18:56.738 --> 00:18:57.798
there previously,

00:18:57.817 --> 00:18:58.818
it wasn't just that humans

00:18:58.838 --> 00:19:01.200
were creating the original content.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:01.940
And I think this happens a

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.279
lot in the software

00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:04.681
development space where you

00:19:04.721 --> 00:19:05.842
may be using an LLM to

00:19:05.882 --> 00:19:07.342
generate lots of code to

00:19:07.382 --> 00:19:08.603
put up a bunch of pull requests.

00:19:10.884 --> 00:19:13.265
The amount of code is so high,

00:19:14.085 --> 00:19:15.244
the number of images or

00:19:15.286 --> 00:19:15.806
videos that you're

00:19:15.826 --> 00:19:17.026
generating is such a large

00:19:17.046 --> 00:19:18.747
amount that the flows you

00:19:18.767 --> 00:19:19.987
were using to review that

00:19:20.428 --> 00:19:23.148
initially may not be even viable anymore.

00:19:23.769 --> 00:19:27.811
So like we fundamentally may

00:19:27.852 --> 00:19:29.093
have to actually change how

00:19:29.153 --> 00:19:30.153
we're evaluating and how

00:19:30.173 --> 00:19:31.173
we're actually reviewing

00:19:31.953 --> 00:19:32.414
the things that we're

00:19:32.454 --> 00:19:33.955
generating using LLMs.

00:19:35.416 --> 00:19:35.977
Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:36.517 --> 00:19:37.218
And this is really where I

00:19:37.258 --> 00:19:39.638
think automated tests come in handy.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:42.361
I think this is really where, you know,

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:42.760
this is kind of

00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:45.945
Not necessarily what we do

00:19:45.965 --> 00:19:46.866
today in terms of our product,

00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:47.886
but synthetic data,

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:50.670
creating data to make sure

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.212
that you test against all

00:19:53.232 --> 00:19:54.913
the different edge cases is important.

00:19:56.075 --> 00:20:00.179
And having the proper evals

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.101
in terms of evaluating the models,

00:20:02.621 --> 00:20:03.461
so the model is being fine

00:20:03.521 --> 00:20:04.163
tuned in the proper

00:20:04.182 --> 00:20:06.224
direction for the proper outcomes.

00:20:06.565 --> 00:20:07.566
Those are the things that

00:20:07.586 --> 00:20:08.686
come in play when it comes to,

00:20:09.268 --> 00:20:09.847
it's not just

00:20:12.277 --> 00:20:15.479
human reviewing the massive output,

00:20:15.519 --> 00:20:16.920
but kind of a systematic

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.961
approach to fine tuning and

00:20:20.241 --> 00:20:20.922
improving the models.

00:20:20.942 --> 00:20:22.522
Yeah,

00:20:22.542 --> 00:20:24.284
I can see there being a lot of value

00:20:24.424 --> 00:20:25.744
in that review platform.

00:20:26.486 --> 00:20:26.986
I'm curious,

00:20:28.267 --> 00:20:29.167
I think this question keeps

00:20:29.188 --> 00:20:30.489
coming up in any number of

00:20:30.509 --> 00:20:31.608
the communities that I'm in,

00:20:31.828 --> 00:20:33.490
like what's the best LLM or

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.590
what's the best model out

00:20:34.611 --> 00:20:36.853
there either to run with or

00:20:37.192 --> 00:20:38.513
to potentially retrain

00:20:39.013 --> 00:20:41.277
Do you see them as like also

00:20:41.396 --> 00:20:42.897
interchangeable for the most part?

00:20:42.959 --> 00:20:44.559
Like there's one that's better today,

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:45.682
but in three months or six

00:20:45.721 --> 00:20:46.221
months from now,

00:20:46.342 --> 00:20:47.544
it could be a totally different one.

00:20:47.644 --> 00:20:49.625
And have you oriented your

00:20:49.685 --> 00:20:51.307
tech or your business around that idea?

00:20:51.468 --> 00:20:52.489
Or do you feel like you're

00:20:52.528 --> 00:20:54.211
mostly bought into a single

00:20:54.351 --> 00:20:55.813
one for today and it would

00:20:55.853 --> 00:20:56.713
take a lot of work

00:20:56.753 --> 00:20:58.695
potentially to change in the future?

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:00.558
Yeah, I mean,

00:21:00.598 --> 00:21:02.079
I think the thesis of our company,

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.361
as soon as we found it, in fact,

00:21:03.582 --> 00:21:05.022
you could kind of review,

00:21:05.522 --> 00:21:07.505
see this TechCrunch Disrupt

00:21:08.265 --> 00:21:10.126
interview I gave a couple of years ago,

00:21:10.626 --> 00:21:11.528
before the whole Gen-AI.

00:21:11.607 --> 00:21:12.228
We were actually the first

00:21:12.268 --> 00:21:13.930
company to present as a

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:14.769
Gen-AI company at

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.853
TechCrunch Disrupt as a

00:21:17.873 --> 00:21:18.953
finalist on their stage.

00:21:19.094 --> 00:21:20.035
They had a similar question,

00:21:20.055 --> 00:21:20.454
which is like,

00:21:22.432 --> 00:21:24.054
Why are you focusing on the application?

00:21:24.335 --> 00:21:25.015
What is the strategy for

00:21:25.055 --> 00:21:25.776
focusing on the application

00:21:25.796 --> 00:21:26.256
level at Layer?

00:21:26.276 --> 00:21:28.137
You get your seeding

00:21:28.739 --> 00:21:29.479
leveraged through these

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:31.040
foundation models and the

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.364
best models providing this base content.

00:21:34.384 --> 00:21:35.705
And the answer you give then,

00:21:35.726 --> 00:21:36.405
I think the answer you give

00:21:36.605 --> 00:21:38.147
today hasn't changed,

00:21:38.188 --> 00:21:39.970
which is this technology is

00:21:40.009 --> 00:21:41.030
largely being commoditized.

00:21:44.853 --> 00:21:46.012
And there's a pressure for

00:21:46.192 --> 00:21:46.893
the commodities of this

00:21:46.932 --> 00:21:48.513
technology because the

00:21:48.534 --> 00:21:49.594
innovations are open sourced.

00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:52.234
It was open sourced then and

00:21:52.255 --> 00:21:55.435
it's open sourced even more today.

00:21:55.556 --> 00:21:57.277
There's massive competitive

00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:58.257
pressure by the big tech

00:21:58.297 --> 00:22:00.198
companies to develop

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.080
innovations and make it

00:22:03.121 --> 00:22:04.122
cheaper and better and

00:22:04.162 --> 00:22:05.801
faster at an incredible

00:22:05.821 --> 00:22:06.942
velocity because it helps

00:22:06.961 --> 00:22:08.501
their cloud businesses largely.

00:22:08.982 --> 00:22:09.942
And so in order for powering

00:22:09.962 --> 00:22:10.682
the cloud businesses,

00:22:10.702 --> 00:22:12.502
they need to keep innovating this space.

00:22:12.522 --> 00:22:14.923
There's a financial pressure to do that.

00:22:16.104 --> 00:22:19.404
And so for us,

00:22:19.424 --> 00:22:21.704
we've always been kind of plug and play.

00:22:21.724 --> 00:22:23.144
What's the best model at any given moment?

00:22:23.846 --> 00:22:25.385
And we'll switch out models if

00:22:26.448 --> 00:22:27.307
there's one model that

00:22:27.327 --> 00:22:28.548
performs better in a certain domain.

00:22:29.048 --> 00:22:31.150
And there's also that.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.851
And then I think the other

00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:32.471
element is just being

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:33.310
transparent with customers

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:33.971
as well in terms of what

00:22:34.011 --> 00:22:34.592
models we're using.

00:22:34.612 --> 00:22:36.932
Because certain models have safeguards.

00:22:36.972 --> 00:22:37.814
Other models don't.

00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:38.334
Certain models,

00:22:38.773 --> 00:22:39.974
in terms of maybe their

00:22:40.214 --> 00:22:41.355
data protection might be.

00:22:42.496 --> 00:22:42.955
There are various.

00:22:43.817 --> 00:22:45.017
Every model has its own

00:22:45.857 --> 00:22:48.199
unique quirks and nuances and issues,

00:22:48.259 --> 00:22:49.400
both legally in terms of

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.539
the output and the training.

00:22:50.579 --> 00:22:52.641
And so we're very

00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:53.402
transparent with customers

00:22:53.461 --> 00:22:54.102
in terms of what they're

00:22:54.142 --> 00:22:55.241
comfortable powering their

00:22:55.281 --> 00:22:56.143
advertising content with.

00:23:00.604 --> 00:23:03.224
Interesting.

00:23:03.285 --> 00:23:09.406
So you said that the written

00:23:09.446 --> 00:23:11.127
content is going into

00:23:11.228 --> 00:23:13.528
OpenAI's chat GPT in some cases, right?

00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.910
Yeah, I mean,

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.570
OpenAI has APIs for accessing

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.551
their foundation models and

00:23:20.571 --> 00:23:21.112
just some of that.

00:23:21.192 --> 00:23:23.032
But there is a toggle you

00:23:23.053 --> 00:23:24.393
can use when using OpenAI

00:23:25.054 --> 00:23:26.433
where you can ask to not

00:23:26.473 --> 00:23:27.894
train on the data that

00:23:27.914 --> 00:23:28.335
you're sending them.

00:23:29.045 --> 00:23:29.125
Yeah,

00:23:29.265 --> 00:23:30.385
but your customers don't necessarily

00:23:30.405 --> 00:23:30.726
know that.

00:23:30.806 --> 00:23:33.548
So how do you, is it transparent?

00:23:34.067 --> 00:23:34.847
We do, we do.

00:23:34.887 --> 00:23:36.169
So part of our terms is

00:23:36.189 --> 00:23:37.809
we're transparent with the

00:23:37.829 --> 00:23:38.650
customer in terms of which

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:39.230
models we're using.

00:23:39.891 --> 00:23:41.471
And if we're sharing their

00:23:41.491 --> 00:23:42.593
data with any third party.

00:23:43.053 --> 00:23:45.294
And if a customer is not interested,

00:23:45.894 --> 00:23:49.476
not open to sharing the data,

00:23:49.496 --> 00:23:50.896
then we will change the models.

00:23:52.538 --> 00:23:53.459
Or limit the functionality

00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:55.098
of the product so that

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:57.760
they're completely transparent.

00:23:58.912 --> 00:23:59.692
you know, place safe there.

00:23:59.712 --> 00:24:01.375
And actually this was, you know,

00:24:01.394 --> 00:24:02.275
just going over a legal

00:24:02.635 --> 00:24:04.217
document yesterday on this

00:24:04.237 --> 00:24:05.858
with one of our customers.

00:24:06.219 --> 00:24:08.240
A lot of our customers are agencies or,

00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:09.522
you know, advertising agencies.

00:24:09.583 --> 00:24:11.403
And they work with some of

00:24:11.423 --> 00:24:12.125
the biggest brands.

00:24:13.086 --> 00:24:13.646
And, you know,

00:24:13.787 --> 00:24:14.748
as part of an advertising

00:24:14.807 --> 00:24:16.048
agency working with a big brand, you know,

00:24:16.088 --> 00:24:17.009
you have to, you know,

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.271
indemnify and do liability

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.512
protection and do all these

00:24:20.532 --> 00:24:22.374
things because obviously

00:24:22.394 --> 00:24:23.255
the big brand doesn't want

00:24:23.275 --> 00:24:24.715
to accidentally expose

00:24:24.736 --> 00:24:25.797
themselves in terms of data

00:24:25.817 --> 00:24:27.818
leakage or or copy right

00:24:27.838 --> 00:24:28.980
violation through their

00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:30.480
agency and so and so

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.842
therefore that then is

00:24:31.882 --> 00:24:32.903
passed to us in terms of

00:24:32.923 --> 00:24:35.345
that vigilance to make sure

00:24:35.585 --> 00:24:36.945
that you know there's a we

00:24:36.965 --> 00:24:38.667
would you know when it comes to

00:24:40.935 --> 00:24:41.135
Therefore,

00:24:41.155 --> 00:24:42.157
there's pressure for us as well

00:24:42.438 --> 00:24:43.339
to make sure that all those

00:24:43.359 --> 00:24:45.723
safeguards are being met in

00:24:45.743 --> 00:24:48.829
terms of data protection, data leakage,

00:24:50.132 --> 00:24:51.976
and that copyright concern.

00:24:52.682 --> 00:24:55.585
So if I'm running an AI company, I'm not,

00:24:55.625 --> 00:24:57.987
but if I were and we were

00:24:58.047 --> 00:25:00.209
using some other company's models,

00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:02.570
either through an API or a public model,

00:25:03.852 --> 00:25:05.693
do you see that there's a

00:25:05.834 --> 00:25:07.715
more common concern in a way?

00:25:07.836 --> 00:25:08.757
Is it, oh,

00:25:08.797 --> 00:25:11.038
we don't want you to train on our data?

00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:12.519
I've seen that one.

00:25:12.941 --> 00:25:14.701
I'm curious how frequently that comes up.

00:25:14.761 --> 00:25:15.482
And then potentially,

00:25:15.823 --> 00:25:17.404
do you see requirements that

00:25:17.865 --> 00:25:19.424
there are certain companies you can't use,

00:25:19.464 --> 00:25:20.846
like certain companies are fine.

00:25:20.905 --> 00:25:21.965
Certain models are okay.

00:25:22.306 --> 00:25:23.905
Or do your customers, they usually are,

00:25:24.165 --> 00:25:24.705
are like,

00:25:24.726 --> 00:25:25.906
they're using your product to do,

00:25:26.386 --> 00:25:27.426
they know they're using AI.

00:25:27.646 --> 00:25:28.987
They know they're using your

00:25:29.166 --> 00:25:30.086
LMS that have been

00:25:30.106 --> 00:25:31.508
retrained from other models

00:25:31.528 --> 00:25:32.008
under the hood.

00:25:32.468 --> 00:25:33.907
And they generally are okay with that.

00:25:33.928 --> 00:25:35.448
Yeah.

00:25:35.508 --> 00:25:37.729
So, um, it really depends on,

00:25:37.888 --> 00:25:38.368
on the model.

00:25:38.409 --> 00:25:40.229
So there are certain models, like some,

00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.910
there are some sort of

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.029
state of the art models today that, um,

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.481
And by the way,

00:25:45.582 --> 00:25:47.604
there are some really

00:25:47.644 --> 00:25:48.825
popular consumer apps today,

00:25:49.825 --> 00:25:51.126
very mainstream ones used

00:25:51.186 --> 00:25:53.568
in enterprises and just by

00:25:54.348 --> 00:25:58.653
individuals that have zero

00:25:58.752 --> 00:25:59.453
liability protection.

00:25:59.554 --> 00:26:00.755
It's maximum of a hundred

00:26:00.795 --> 00:26:02.296
dollars that they'll pay if

00:26:02.336 --> 00:26:02.856
there's an issue.

00:26:04.057 --> 00:26:04.717
And as a consumer,

00:26:04.797 --> 00:26:05.317
oftentimes you're not

00:26:05.336 --> 00:26:06.298
reading the terms and conditions.

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:07.778
So you aren't aware that

00:26:07.798 --> 00:26:08.518
you're taking that risk

00:26:08.557 --> 00:26:10.077
when you use a product like this.

00:26:10.598 --> 00:26:11.798
But most generic consumer,

00:26:12.058 --> 00:26:13.578
I would say almost all

00:26:13.638 --> 00:26:14.838
consumer generic companies today,

00:26:15.058 --> 00:26:16.579
if we use it, has,

00:26:16.819 --> 00:26:17.900
in terms and conditions,

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:20.961
I get a cap on their liability.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.520
It was like about a hundred dollars.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.221
And so consumers are taking

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.382
that risk when they're

00:26:25.481 --> 00:26:28.102
using some app to generate

00:26:28.142 --> 00:26:29.803
some image or video and

00:26:29.843 --> 00:26:31.163
kind of sharing it online.

00:26:32.103 --> 00:26:33.983
the potential IP that they're violating.

00:26:34.923 --> 00:26:36.444
When it comes to enterprise,

00:26:37.464 --> 00:26:38.685
enterprises are very,

00:26:38.746 --> 00:26:40.547
very sensitive to this,

00:26:40.586 --> 00:26:42.287
and so they'll almost require

00:26:44.785 --> 00:26:45.766
you know,

00:26:45.786 --> 00:26:46.865
indemnity protection and

00:26:47.066 --> 00:26:47.846
liability protection.

00:26:48.467 --> 00:26:48.987
And so some of these

00:26:49.027 --> 00:26:50.387
enterprise-oriented AI

00:26:50.428 --> 00:26:51.669
companies offer this.

00:26:52.528 --> 00:26:56.611
But the default is no liability protection,

00:26:56.891 --> 00:26:57.692
no indemnity.

00:26:57.951 --> 00:27:01.153
And so, you know, a lot of consumer apps,

00:27:01.513 --> 00:27:02.314
almost all the consumer

00:27:02.334 --> 00:27:02.894
apps are like this,

00:27:02.913 --> 00:27:04.674
a lot of APIs are therefore like this.

00:27:05.096 --> 00:27:06.175
So if you're using, you know,

00:27:06.195 --> 00:27:08.798
a state-of-the-art model, you may not,

00:27:08.938 --> 00:27:09.377
you know,

00:27:11.404 --> 00:27:12.105
there's a lot you know

00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:12.726
there's a lot of really

00:27:12.746 --> 00:27:13.626
interesting nuances here

00:27:13.666 --> 00:27:14.728
again you know also some of

00:27:14.748 --> 00:27:15.948
these models um that are

00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:16.949
open source they're not a

00:27:17.009 --> 00:27:18.450
commercial license uh so

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:19.171
you actually can't

00:27:19.351 --> 00:27:20.132
commercially use these

00:27:20.172 --> 00:27:20.912
models that are open source

00:27:20.932 --> 00:27:21.573
even though they're the

00:27:21.613 --> 00:27:22.413
technology is out there you

00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:23.094
can play around with it but

00:27:23.114 --> 00:27:23.614
you can't actually use it

00:27:23.634 --> 00:27:25.075
for business because it

00:27:25.115 --> 00:27:25.935
isn't commercialized you

00:27:25.955 --> 00:27:26.695
have to go and negotiate

00:27:26.715 --> 00:27:27.596
commercial license directly

00:27:27.616 --> 00:27:28.337
with the model provider

00:27:30.597 --> 00:27:30.857
Um, you know,

00:27:30.877 --> 00:27:32.019
if you actually say if they're an API, uh,

00:27:32.298 --> 00:27:34.339
then, you know,

00:27:34.359 --> 00:27:34.820
read the terms and

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.221
conditions to make sure that, you know,

00:27:36.281 --> 00:27:37.542
what, what the safeguards are there.

00:27:38.083 --> 00:27:40.364
Um, and again, it, it varies, you know,

00:27:40.423 --> 00:27:42.204
it depends and varies depending on, on,

00:27:42.365 --> 00:27:43.566
on the, on the model provider.

00:27:44.067 --> 00:27:47.608
Uh, but, um, but, uh, but yeah, I mean,

00:27:47.689 --> 00:27:48.630
I think the default

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:50.871
generally is we don't take liability.

00:27:51.691 --> 00:27:53.152
We don't indemnify, you know,

00:27:53.172 --> 00:27:54.633
you're at your own risk, you know,

00:27:54.772 --> 00:27:55.453
using these tools.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.561
Has it been easy to work

00:27:58.602 --> 00:28:00.844
with the companies that are

00:28:00.884 --> 00:28:02.105
providing the foundational

00:28:02.144 --> 00:28:03.246
models to like they

00:28:03.346 --> 00:28:04.567
understand the enterprise risk?

00:28:04.646 --> 00:28:05.807
Or has that been another

00:28:05.847 --> 00:28:06.969
level of a complex

00:28:07.009 --> 00:28:08.009
conversation to have both

00:28:08.069 --> 00:28:10.031
legally and what a support

00:28:10.051 --> 00:28:11.432
contract would look like in

00:28:11.512 --> 00:28:12.473
order for them to provide

00:28:12.493 --> 00:28:14.454
you the safeguards that you

00:28:14.494 --> 00:28:15.276
need so that you can

00:28:15.316 --> 00:28:17.096
promise your clients to

00:28:17.136 --> 00:28:20.279
meet their particular legal?

00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:24.282
Yeah, I think it depends on the company.

00:28:24.303 --> 00:28:25.544
I think

00:28:26.637 --> 00:28:28.358
OpenAI is pretty, you know,

00:28:28.419 --> 00:28:29.019
because they have a big

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:29.819
enterprise business.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.300
They do a lot of this

00:28:31.461 --> 00:28:34.442
liability protection and indemnity.

00:28:35.604 --> 00:28:37.846
But if it's like a startup

00:28:38.946 --> 00:28:41.147
that doesn't necessarily

00:28:41.167 --> 00:28:41.788
have a large enterprise

00:28:41.808 --> 00:28:43.048
business and it's predominantly consumer,

00:28:43.589 --> 00:28:47.372
they don't really, I mean, for them,

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:48.472
they're making enough money

00:28:48.532 --> 00:28:50.013
through consumer apps that

00:28:52.193 --> 00:28:54.275
um you know it's like yeah

00:28:54.315 --> 00:28:55.015
like the risk of

00:28:55.035 --> 00:28:55.555
potentially them

00:28:55.576 --> 00:28:57.215
indemnifying isn't worth um

00:28:57.855 --> 00:28:59.977
uh that potential you know

00:28:59.997 --> 00:29:00.718
line of business because

00:29:00.738 --> 00:29:02.018
they're not focused on on

00:29:02.057 --> 00:29:03.638
enterprise and um

00:29:04.453 --> 00:29:05.074
Yeah, so it depends.

00:29:05.153 --> 00:29:07.875
I think it's not like, but yeah,

00:29:07.894 --> 00:29:09.496
these are areas where I think, you know,

00:29:09.536 --> 00:29:10.215
you know, yeah, I mean,

00:29:10.256 --> 00:29:11.215
we've reached out directly

00:29:11.236 --> 00:29:13.457
with various companies and

00:29:13.497 --> 00:29:16.097
model providers and places

00:29:16.117 --> 00:29:18.578
that host these models to

00:29:18.598 --> 00:29:19.638
figure out the right terms and, you know,

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:21.880
get clarity regarding data

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.920
training and things like this.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.780
And it is kind of, again,

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.760
on a case by case basis.

00:29:31.383 --> 00:29:32.544
I know Jillian was really

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.384
excited by the topic of AI

00:29:34.404 --> 00:29:35.345
whenever it comes up.

00:29:35.365 --> 00:29:35.846
I am.

00:29:35.965 --> 00:29:37.527
I'm always so happy about it.

00:29:37.586 --> 00:29:38.646
I could just ask you and ask

00:29:38.666 --> 00:29:39.488
you and ask you questions

00:29:39.508 --> 00:29:40.709
forever and ever and ever, I think.

00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:42.430
Well, this is your opportunity.

00:29:42.829 --> 00:29:43.089
I know.

00:29:43.109 --> 00:29:44.029
Don't worry.

00:29:44.131 --> 00:29:44.891
I'm going for it.

00:29:44.971 --> 00:29:45.770
I'm wondering,

00:29:46.491 --> 00:29:47.673
what is the kind of backend

00:29:47.732 --> 00:29:48.633
that you guys are doing?

00:29:48.732 --> 00:29:50.453
Since we are a DevOps podcast,

00:29:50.473 --> 00:29:51.214
are you using cloud?

00:29:51.234 --> 00:29:52.635
Do you have your own server farm?

00:29:52.675 --> 00:29:53.155
What are you...

00:29:53.755 --> 00:29:54.355
What are you doing?

00:29:54.375 --> 00:29:55.397
And then also if you're using,

00:29:56.019 --> 00:29:56.820
it sounds like you're using

00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:58.003
like the foundational models,

00:29:58.044 --> 00:29:59.567
but if you're using any custom models,

00:29:59.606 --> 00:30:00.328
how are you dealing with

00:30:00.348 --> 00:30:01.872
like hosting and deploying those?

00:30:01.892 --> 00:30:03.816
Like just walk through your whole setup.

00:30:03.836 --> 00:30:04.297
What's going on?

00:30:05.305 --> 00:30:05.545
Yeah,

00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:07.145
so we're an Amazon Marketplace partner,

00:30:07.247 --> 00:30:08.627
and as part of being an

00:30:08.688 --> 00:30:09.848
Amazon Marketplace partner,

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:14.291
our infrastructure is hosted on AWS.

00:30:15.133 --> 00:30:18.275
So I can probably pull up a

00:30:18.295 --> 00:30:20.135
diagram in terms of this,

00:30:20.596 --> 00:30:25.039
but then in terms of the models,

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.721
we'd either be hosting

00:30:27.761 --> 00:30:32.945
models within Amazon servers,

00:30:33.125 --> 00:30:34.807
or we'll be doing access through an API.

00:30:36.246 --> 00:30:36.566
I mean,

00:30:36.605 --> 00:30:38.327
throw out some AWS service names

00:30:38.367 --> 00:30:40.990
here using like SageMaker and Bedrock and,

00:30:42.351 --> 00:30:44.692
you know, whatever through guardrails or,

00:30:44.952 --> 00:30:46.193
you know, what's going on there?

00:30:46.394 --> 00:30:47.615
Are you like pure virtual

00:30:47.634 --> 00:30:48.414
machines or bare metal?

00:30:48.434 --> 00:30:51.298
SageMaker UI, like what's going on?

00:30:51.317 --> 00:30:51.857
Yeah.

00:30:52.298 --> 00:30:54.700
I haven't talked about that

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.101
UI for like weeks.

00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:56.501
It's been like four weeks.

00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.002
I still can't make heads or tails of it.

00:30:59.178 --> 00:30:59.498
Yeah, I mean,

00:30:59.518 --> 00:31:00.897
we use a lot of those in SageMaker.

00:31:00.958 --> 00:31:01.739
I think predominantly that

00:31:02.058 --> 00:31:05.480
we access through various other APIs.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.559
I'm not sure how much of

00:31:08.881 --> 00:31:09.800
SageMaker we use today.

00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:11.020
You can also note that I'm

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.082
not the CEO of the company,

00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:14.821
and so we have a person

00:31:14.862 --> 00:31:15.782
dedicated to responding.

00:31:15.803 --> 00:31:17.442
They would be a lot more

00:31:17.462 --> 00:31:18.643
better at answering these questions.

00:31:22.931 --> 00:31:24.692
um you know we're on amazon

00:31:24.711 --> 00:31:25.512
we can just keep talking

00:31:25.532 --> 00:31:26.473
about the front end stuff

00:31:26.493 --> 00:31:27.835
then that's I mean yeah a

00:31:28.055 --> 00:31:28.755
little bit more like ml

00:31:28.795 --> 00:31:29.736
than devops but uh that's

00:31:30.036 --> 00:31:31.298
fine for me so we're good

00:31:32.538 --> 00:31:33.519
yeah so there's like an s

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:36.080
three router uh uh sorry

00:31:36.101 --> 00:31:36.922
there's a necessary bucket

00:31:36.942 --> 00:31:38.584
with all the media stored

00:31:38.743 --> 00:31:39.723
uh the content stored it's

00:31:39.743 --> 00:31:40.924
gonna be we're almost like

00:31:41.586 --> 00:31:42.547
a dam a digital asset

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:43.528
management tool for our

00:31:43.567 --> 00:31:44.648
customers and so we manage

00:31:44.989 --> 00:31:45.788
uh all the customers brand

00:31:45.829 --> 00:31:46.329
assets and all the

00:31:46.369 --> 00:31:47.330
generative assets as well

00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:49.231
um so that is quite a large

00:31:49.271 --> 00:31:50.773
part of the tool and then um

00:31:52.213 --> 00:31:54.075
We have load balancers that

00:31:54.115 --> 00:31:55.974
connect to the Nexus,

00:31:56.015 --> 00:31:57.815
which is then connected to PostgreSQL.

00:31:58.355 --> 00:31:59.655
Oh, that's really in the weeds.

00:32:00.236 --> 00:32:01.215
That's probably more than

00:32:01.796 --> 00:32:03.696
you need to expose to anyone.

00:32:03.797 --> 00:32:04.196
So, I mean,

00:32:04.797 --> 00:32:06.916
you're basically utilizing AWS

00:32:07.617 --> 00:32:08.617
infrastructure as much as

00:32:08.678 --> 00:32:12.199
possible for running your product,

00:32:12.838 --> 00:32:13.719
your services through there.

00:32:13.739 --> 00:32:15.358
Yeah, but it's Dockerized.

00:32:15.459 --> 00:32:16.880
We can go and...

00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:20.207
hosted as a different server

00:32:20.847 --> 00:32:21.968
or a different kind of cloud provider.

00:32:22.847 --> 00:32:25.209
But yeah, today,

00:32:25.348 --> 00:32:26.388
we just kind of started with Amazon,

00:32:26.409 --> 00:32:27.289
and they gave us some nice credits.

00:32:28.589 --> 00:32:29.971
And so most of it is on Amazon.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:30.631
I understand.

00:32:30.711 --> 00:32:32.290
That's how I got started with Amazon, too,

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:33.152
is they gave me money.

00:32:33.172 --> 00:32:34.771
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:34.791 --> 00:32:35.592
They are very generous with

00:32:35.612 --> 00:32:36.833
those start credits.

00:32:36.873 --> 00:32:38.212
Oh, they really are.

00:32:38.512 --> 00:32:38.813
They're good.

00:32:38.853 --> 00:32:39.874
If you keep harassing them, too,

00:32:39.913 --> 00:32:41.753
about their new services, be like, oh,

00:32:41.773 --> 00:32:43.134
this new thing that you guys have,

00:32:43.234 --> 00:32:44.115
I think it will really

00:32:44.134 --> 00:32:45.295
transform my business.

00:32:45.394 --> 00:32:46.796
And then give you money.

00:32:47.155 --> 00:32:47.757
I don't know that I should

00:32:47.777 --> 00:32:49.019
be admitting to that on the air,

00:32:49.118 --> 00:32:52.923
but I guess that's what we're doing.

00:32:52.942 --> 00:32:53.624
They have great customer

00:32:53.663 --> 00:32:54.464
support when it comes to

00:32:54.484 --> 00:32:56.768
supporting startups and help, you know.

00:32:56.929 --> 00:32:58.510
Yeah, I mean, they've been great.

00:32:59.309 --> 00:32:59.509
Well,

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.151
I think it's absolutely fantastic

00:33:01.191 --> 00:33:02.010
that you've managed to

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:02.971
figure out a way to put

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.771
your models within Docker

00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:05.971
containers and are standing

00:33:05.991 --> 00:33:07.633
them up in AWS because I

00:33:07.653 --> 00:33:08.893
know just so many companies

00:33:08.932 --> 00:33:10.394
would swear by needing to

00:33:10.433 --> 00:33:13.234
buy the GPUs and install

00:33:13.255 --> 00:33:14.315
them in local data centers

00:33:14.414 --> 00:33:16.296
or run them under their dev,

00:33:17.796 --> 00:33:18.916
whoever their engineers are,

00:33:18.977 --> 00:33:19.896
run them under their desks

00:33:19.916 --> 00:33:21.196
in order to be effective

00:33:21.237 --> 00:33:22.117
there because they would

00:33:22.198 --> 00:33:23.198
complain that maybe the

00:33:23.258 --> 00:33:24.117
cloud is too expensive.

00:33:24.218 --> 00:33:25.558
And then the customers that are using

00:33:26.578 --> 00:33:27.940
or building models in even

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.501
AWS are using ECQ machines

00:33:30.582 --> 00:33:31.583
straight out and not

00:33:31.603 --> 00:33:32.583
necessarily containers and

00:33:32.623 --> 00:33:34.865
then have sort of not great flows.

00:33:34.924 --> 00:33:36.086
I think there is this weird

00:33:36.826 --> 00:33:38.586
mix here where the

00:33:38.646 --> 00:33:40.048
companies that may have

00:33:40.107 --> 00:33:41.469
great models or great

00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:42.509
attention to what's going

00:33:42.569 --> 00:33:44.431
on in the AI space aren't

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.491
so great at what is

00:33:46.731 --> 00:33:48.894
considered best practices

00:33:48.913 --> 00:33:50.034
from a DevOps standpoint.

00:33:50.054 --> 00:33:51.474
And it does seem like, you know,

00:33:51.555 --> 00:33:52.635
at least as far as

00:33:52.675 --> 00:33:54.156
evolution goes in technology, like,

00:33:54.217 --> 00:33:54.877
you know, you've made

00:33:55.837 --> 00:33:57.118
I think you're further ahead

00:33:57.219 --> 00:33:58.640
than what most companies I

00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.840
talk to that are doing some

00:33:59.861 --> 00:34:01.583
sort of AI are at.

00:34:01.603 --> 00:34:02.442
Well, that's really great to hear.

00:34:02.462 --> 00:34:03.023
Thank you.

00:34:03.364 --> 00:34:03.584
Yeah, I mean,

00:34:03.604 --> 00:34:04.704
I think we also bought some

00:34:04.924 --> 00:34:06.086
GVs ourselves and kind of

00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:06.886
playing around with them

00:34:06.926 --> 00:34:08.228
and experimenting with them ourselves.

00:34:08.268 --> 00:34:10.409
But yeah, I mean,

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:11.931
I think the scalability is

00:34:11.951 --> 00:34:13.052
a lot better through these

00:34:13.072 --> 00:34:13.672
cloud providers.

00:34:13.731 --> 00:34:14.432
I mean, first of all,

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:15.414
it's hard to get your hands

00:34:15.454 --> 00:34:17.394
up physically on, say, H-Line hundreds.

00:34:18.476 --> 00:34:20.036
And then so it's a lot

00:34:20.097 --> 00:34:21.798
easier to get through these

00:34:21.838 --> 00:34:22.458
cloud providers.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:23.960
And

00:34:24.911 --> 00:34:25.952
And then, you know, then just again,

00:34:25.972 --> 00:34:26.333
scaling,

00:34:26.373 --> 00:34:27.253
deploying and all these things

00:34:27.333 --> 00:34:29.115
also a lot easier, um, through, uh,

00:34:29.416 --> 00:34:29.936
through the cloud.

00:34:29.956 --> 00:34:31.297
So, um, you know, for us,

00:34:31.317 --> 00:34:32.478
like we're not trying to, you know,

00:34:32.498 --> 00:34:33.219
make our lives harder.

00:34:33.298 --> 00:34:33.918
We're just trying to build

00:34:33.938 --> 00:34:36.161
the best application utilizing AI.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.284
So like, uh, you know,

00:34:40.304 --> 00:34:41.005
like we have all the

00:34:41.065 --> 00:34:41.925
engineers focus on that.

00:34:42.507 --> 00:34:46.110
And, um, um, yeah, like if it's, yeah,

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.550
there's just a whole level

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:48.652
of complexity associated

00:34:48.672 --> 00:34:52.914
with GPUs and get them

00:34:52.934 --> 00:34:53.735
properly set up and all this.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:54.621
I mean,

00:34:54.641 --> 00:34:55.842
I am a little curious about the pipeline,

00:34:55.862 --> 00:34:56.641
which you may not have too

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:57.583
much insight into,

00:34:57.922 --> 00:34:59.063
like the foundational model

00:34:59.083 --> 00:34:59.963
that you're getting from Flux.

00:35:01.445 --> 00:35:02.344
Where is that coming in?

00:35:02.385 --> 00:35:02.505
Like,

00:35:02.545 --> 00:35:04.525
are you getting that outside of AWS

00:35:04.686 --> 00:35:06.007
and then basically

00:35:06.027 --> 00:35:07.387
injecting that into AWS to

00:35:07.407 --> 00:35:08.168
do the retraining?

00:35:08.407 --> 00:35:09.768
Or is it being provided

00:35:09.809 --> 00:35:12.971
somehow through either like

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.150
available in some way

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.972
through the marketplace

00:35:14.992 --> 00:35:15.791
that you can get and then

00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:17.193
retrain it within AWS?

00:35:17.293 --> 00:35:18.072
Or like,

00:35:18.193 --> 00:35:18.833
I don't know if you have any

00:35:18.853 --> 00:35:19.594
insight into that,

00:35:19.634 --> 00:35:20.855
but that'd be a little bit interesting.

00:35:21.532 --> 00:35:21.753
Yeah,

00:35:21.773 --> 00:35:23.795
so there's a couple of model provider

00:35:23.835 --> 00:35:25.916
companies that support, say,

00:35:25.936 --> 00:35:26.556
the Flux model.

00:35:27.117 --> 00:35:29.018
So we kind of experiment

00:35:29.038 --> 00:35:30.259
with many of them in terms

00:35:30.338 --> 00:35:31.980
of their speed and cost,

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.400
the quality of the outputs.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.762
So there's a company called

00:35:34.782 --> 00:35:36.884
Replicate that's pretty good at this.

00:35:36.923 --> 00:35:37.983
And there's a company called Fowl.

00:35:38.344 --> 00:35:39.706
There's some other companies,

00:35:39.766 --> 00:35:42.367
and they have APIs.

00:35:46.128 --> 00:35:46.869
What do the APIs do?

00:35:46.909 --> 00:35:47.028
Like,

00:35:47.068 --> 00:35:48.869
are you getting just the foundational

00:35:48.909 --> 00:35:49.889
model from them and then

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:51.811
you are retraining in some

00:35:51.851 --> 00:35:53.751
way or are you retraining

00:35:53.771 --> 00:35:54.811
it within their product?

00:35:54.853 --> 00:35:55.893
How does that work?

00:35:55.952 --> 00:35:58.193
Yeah, so these APIs,

00:35:58.514 --> 00:36:00.094
there's many kind of parameters.

00:36:00.175 --> 00:36:00.976
So you have, say,

00:36:01.016 --> 00:36:02.556
the training images that

00:36:02.576 --> 00:36:03.876
you need to send to them.

00:36:04.456 --> 00:36:05.838
Maybe you have some other parameters,

00:36:05.878 --> 00:36:06.597
like the number of training

00:36:06.637 --> 00:36:08.179
steps you want to do or

00:36:08.219 --> 00:36:09.599
when you're generating that content,

00:36:09.619 --> 00:36:10.699
like the LoRa scales,

00:36:10.739 --> 00:36:13.342
like how... So there's like...

00:36:14.346 --> 00:36:15.545
a couple of parameters

00:36:15.786 --> 00:36:17.067
associated with training

00:36:17.086 --> 00:36:17.907
the models and generating

00:36:17.927 --> 00:36:18.847
content based on the models.

00:36:19.327 --> 00:36:23.307
And so you can use these

00:36:23.327 --> 00:36:24.088
tools also online.

00:36:24.108 --> 00:36:26.409
They have online interfaces

00:36:26.449 --> 00:36:27.188
where it lets you adjust it.

00:36:27.208 --> 00:36:28.829
But you can also do it through an API.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:31.349
And so then we're generating

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:32.409
hyper-realistic, say,

00:36:32.469 --> 00:36:34.490
images based on product

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:36.010
photos through those APIs.

00:36:37.539 --> 00:36:38.519
In those examples,

00:36:38.599 --> 00:36:39.380
are you sending your

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.001
customers images to replicate,

00:36:42.021 --> 00:36:43.463
for instance, to train the model,

00:36:43.563 --> 00:36:44.862
or is it like a two-step

00:36:44.882 --> 00:36:46.103
process where first you're

00:36:47.065 --> 00:36:48.125
fine-tuning the model

00:36:48.164 --> 00:36:49.106
through the APIs they have

00:36:49.146 --> 00:36:49.766
and then taking the

00:36:49.806 --> 00:36:50.766
resulting model and

00:36:52.047 --> 00:36:53.327
optimizing it for each of

00:36:53.347 --> 00:36:54.628
your customers individually?

00:36:55.429 --> 00:36:58.269
Yeah, so in this particular instance,

00:36:58.369 --> 00:37:01.192
and we would be sending the

00:37:01.231 --> 00:37:02.632
photos to the customer,

00:37:02.931 --> 00:37:04.092
the product photos to the customer.

00:37:04.552 --> 00:37:05.233
This is, again,

00:37:05.273 --> 00:37:06.534
where I gave the earlier

00:37:06.554 --> 00:37:08.074
example of talking directly

00:37:08.094 --> 00:37:08.954
with the model provider.

00:37:09.614 --> 00:37:11.016
So in this instance,

00:37:11.056 --> 00:37:12.275
I directly with replicates.

00:37:12.436 --> 00:37:13.677
You do not confirm.

00:37:13.817 --> 00:37:14.876
They do not train on that data.

00:37:15.617 --> 00:37:17.117
They do not, you know,

00:37:19.458 --> 00:37:20.820
and they're not passing

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.159
that data to some other

00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:23.760
party because there's also, you know,

00:37:26.351 --> 00:37:27.992
leakage in terms of the model providers,

00:37:28.452 --> 00:37:31.375
providers as well.

00:37:31.954 --> 00:37:35.757
And so just confirming that.

00:37:36.139 --> 00:37:36.398
And yeah,

00:37:36.418 --> 00:37:37.559
so we have a self-serve tool

00:37:37.579 --> 00:37:39.101
today for anyone to go to our website,

00:37:39.121 --> 00:37:39.460
sign up.

00:37:39.701 --> 00:37:40.362
It's a free trial.

00:37:40.442 --> 00:37:42.043
You can go train images and

00:37:42.083 --> 00:37:43.184
generate images and videos

00:37:43.224 --> 00:37:44.465
of your product, showcase your product.

00:37:48.288 --> 00:37:50.369
And some of that technology

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:53.192
is available through, say,

00:37:53.231 --> 00:37:54.032
companies like Replicate

00:37:54.052 --> 00:37:55.514
and File that host Flux Models.

00:37:55.978 --> 00:37:57.519
I see.

00:37:57.539 --> 00:37:58.920
This sort of brings me to

00:37:59.702 --> 00:38:00.463
something that I keep

00:38:00.503 --> 00:38:02.503
running into sort of theoretically,

00:38:02.543 --> 00:38:03.264
and I'm wondering if in

00:38:03.324 --> 00:38:04.204
practice you've actually

00:38:04.244 --> 00:38:05.065
seen some problems here.

00:38:05.545 --> 00:38:07.248
The models, from my standpoint,

00:38:07.427 --> 00:38:08.989
are quite different from

00:38:09.068 --> 00:38:11.010
each other from generation to generation.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.871
There's not really this

00:38:11.951 --> 00:38:12.871
concept that we have in

00:38:12.891 --> 00:38:13.753
software development of

00:38:13.833 --> 00:38:14.994
semantic versioning, right?

00:38:16.454 --> 00:38:16.894
Yeah, exactly.

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:17.195
I mean,

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:18.436
I feel like every model is like a

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:20.617
different child.

00:38:20.637 --> 00:38:21.139
Right, exactly.

00:38:22.699 --> 00:38:23.760
It has its own kind of like...

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:24.820
you know,

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.081
quirks and nuances and likes and

00:38:27.101 --> 00:38:27.621
dislikes.

00:38:28.061 --> 00:38:29.242
It's like and it's like an

00:38:29.282 --> 00:38:30.943
API to this person that

00:38:30.983 --> 00:38:31.704
it's like with all the

00:38:31.724 --> 00:38:32.824
different like it's not

00:38:32.844 --> 00:38:33.885
like consistent output.

00:38:33.905 --> 00:38:35.385
It's not always like you have this input.

00:38:35.425 --> 00:38:37.346
It always has this output.

00:38:37.746 --> 00:38:38.106
I mean,

00:38:38.226 --> 00:38:39.166
I guess the first thing would be

00:38:39.186 --> 00:38:40.347
just like virtual people or something.

00:38:40.775 --> 00:38:41.215
I mean,

00:38:41.235 --> 00:38:42.596
forget even having consistency

00:38:42.615 --> 00:38:43.556
within the same model.

00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:44.657
I mean, cross, you know,

00:38:44.697 --> 00:38:45.876
from one model to a different one,

00:38:45.896 --> 00:38:46.898
like you obviously have no

00:38:46.938 --> 00:38:48.277
consistency in a lot of ways.

00:38:48.617 --> 00:38:49.498
Is there some process you

00:38:49.539 --> 00:38:51.739
have for doing a validation

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.920
when you actually do switch

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.641
between like upgrade the model?

00:38:54.681 --> 00:38:54.800
I mean,

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.561
there's some benefit arguably of

00:38:56.621 --> 00:38:57.302
the newer model.

00:38:57.322 --> 00:38:58.422
And so at some point you're

00:38:58.442 --> 00:38:59.322
planning on switching to it

00:38:59.422 --> 00:39:00.762
or a company and the flex

00:39:00.782 --> 00:39:01.943
model isn't exactly the same.

00:39:02.423 --> 00:39:02.583
Like,

00:39:03.023 --> 00:39:04.425
is there do you have like a standard

00:39:04.485 --> 00:39:06.365
process which you have sort

00:39:06.385 --> 00:39:07.025
of designed to

00:39:07.505 --> 00:39:08.505
deal with this problem?

00:39:08.666 --> 00:39:09.306
Yeah,

00:39:09.365 --> 00:39:11.106
we either get red team this or like

00:39:11.126 --> 00:39:12.246
we have teams internally

00:39:12.266 --> 00:39:13.708
that test this and just, you know,

00:39:13.748 --> 00:39:15.128
they really just, you know,

00:39:15.168 --> 00:39:16.168
test from every way from

00:39:16.208 --> 00:39:17.668
Sunday and make sure that

00:39:17.708 --> 00:39:19.909
the outputs are kind of aligned with,

00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.568
you know,

00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:21.489
the experience we're trying to

00:39:21.509 --> 00:39:22.030
deliver for customers.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:25.050
And so we just do a lot of

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:26.251
extensive testing ourselves before,

00:39:26.271 --> 00:39:26.710
you know,

00:39:26.751 --> 00:39:28.811
kind of launching it to our

00:39:28.831 --> 00:39:29.490
external customers.

00:39:29.971 --> 00:39:30.592
Have you found any

00:39:30.711 --> 00:39:32.231
interesting problems as a result of that?

00:39:33.702 --> 00:39:34.463
yeah I mean I think

00:39:34.563 --> 00:39:35.603
ultimately it's just you

00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:37.686
know the the uniqueness of

00:39:37.726 --> 00:39:41.409
uh you know like the

00:39:41.449 --> 00:39:42.289
uniqueness of these models

00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:43.469
themselves and kind of it's

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:46.311
not the standard I mean

00:39:46.331 --> 00:39:47.132
there's the standard kind

00:39:47.152 --> 00:39:48.494
of accuracy issues and some

00:39:48.534 --> 00:39:49.255
models are accurate than

00:39:49.295 --> 00:39:50.615
others and things like that

00:39:50.635 --> 00:39:52.097
but also just that these

00:39:52.476 --> 00:39:53.277
each model has like a

00:39:53.338 --> 00:39:54.277
unique personality in terms

00:39:54.318 --> 00:39:54.978
of the way they answer the

00:39:54.998 --> 00:39:57.721
questions and um uh

00:40:00.014 --> 00:40:00.594
And a lot of this is

00:40:00.634 --> 00:40:01.956
actually how they're trained.

00:40:03.077 --> 00:40:04.197
And so there's kind of

00:40:04.217 --> 00:40:05.579
another variable dimension

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:09.141
to consider when kind of

00:40:09.463 --> 00:40:10.202
integrating these models

00:40:10.242 --> 00:40:11.864
into your application.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.760
I think, but yeah, I mean,

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.501
there's numerous kind of, I mean,

00:40:17.541 --> 00:40:18.300
I think there's, again,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.141
the take the back and forth

00:40:21.222 --> 00:40:22.081
or kind of the trade off

00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:24.942
between quality and maybe IP protection,

00:40:24.981 --> 00:40:25.422
you know,

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:26.762
like maybe the most IP protected

00:40:26.822 --> 00:40:28.882
or IP safe model is also

00:40:28.922 --> 00:40:29.523
meant for training very

00:40:29.543 --> 00:40:30.543
limited data and therefore

00:40:30.563 --> 00:40:31.483
the quality isn't as good

00:40:32.204 --> 00:40:34.125
while the best output in

00:40:34.144 --> 00:40:34.744
terms of quality.

00:40:36.715 --> 00:40:39.556
also is very good,

00:40:39.597 --> 00:40:41.336
because I think training

00:40:41.378 --> 00:40:43.057
data is somewhat or largely

00:40:43.097 --> 00:40:43.958
correlated with output.

00:40:43.978 --> 00:40:45.159
And the more data you have,

00:40:45.298 --> 00:40:46.018
the better the model.

00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:49.219
And so the better the model, oftentimes,

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.179
there's more IP risk.

00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:57.282
And so maybe this model, therefore,

00:40:57.782 --> 00:40:59.143
does perform better,

00:40:59.782 --> 00:41:01.503
but we can't use it for a

00:41:03.184 --> 00:41:04.364
particular customer.

00:41:07.047 --> 00:41:12.251
Yeah.

00:41:12.291 --> 00:41:15.273
Cool.

00:41:15.293 --> 00:41:16.094
I'm not even sure what else

00:41:16.114 --> 00:41:17.175
to ask you covered an awful

00:41:17.195 --> 00:41:17.795
lot of ground.

00:41:17.876 --> 00:41:18.956
And it's just it's all neat stuff.

00:41:19.016 --> 00:41:20.277
Are you I'm sure you've got

00:41:20.338 --> 00:41:21.278
some burning question.

00:41:21.298 --> 00:41:21.539
You know,

00:41:21.559 --> 00:41:22.480
you don't want to walk away from

00:41:22.519 --> 00:41:24.561
this and regret later.

00:41:25.322 --> 00:41:26.362
Oh, not at the moment.

00:41:26.382 --> 00:41:28.143
But I'm sure I'm sure that you're right.

00:41:28.184 --> 00:41:29.746
And then as soon as I walk away, like,

00:41:29.786 --> 00:41:29.985
darn,

00:41:30.005 --> 00:41:31.186
there was all these questions I had.

00:41:31.911 --> 00:41:32.032
Well,

00:41:32.052 --> 00:41:33.313
just pretend the podcast is already

00:41:33.413 --> 00:41:36.335
over and then start living that regret.

00:41:36.695 --> 00:41:37.635
And then maybe something

00:41:37.675 --> 00:41:38.376
will come to mind.

00:41:38.896 --> 00:41:39.498
There we go.

00:41:39.637 --> 00:41:40.297
That could be it.

00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:43.019
Well, how many do you have,

00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:44.041
like a big team of data

00:41:44.061 --> 00:41:45.902
scientists at your company

00:41:46.121 --> 00:41:48.324
or like how does that all

00:41:48.344 --> 00:41:49.744
work in terms of like not

00:41:49.784 --> 00:41:50.945
only infrastructure, but also.

00:41:51.697 --> 00:41:52.277
Also people,

00:41:52.297 --> 00:41:53.298
because I think everybody gets

00:41:53.318 --> 00:41:54.400
a little bit freaked out by

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.840
the AI is going to replace

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:56.621
all of our jobs.

00:41:56.661 --> 00:41:57.302
And I'm like, well,

00:41:57.322 --> 00:41:58.001
there's still going to need

00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:00.143
to be people who know how to use the AI.

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:02.585
So maybe, maybe just move along that path,

00:42:02.605 --> 00:42:02.784
guys.

00:42:02.804 --> 00:42:07.367
Yeah, we have thirty employees today.

00:42:08.548 --> 00:42:09.750
The majority are engineers

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.331
and and I would say

00:42:13.391 --> 00:42:14.472
majority of that is like

00:42:14.612 --> 00:42:15.432
machine learning engineers

00:42:15.472 --> 00:42:18.155
data engineers um and kind

00:42:18.175 --> 00:42:20.157
of uh you know obviously

00:42:20.197 --> 00:42:20.777
backend engineers help

00:42:20.797 --> 00:42:21.697
deploy these models and so

00:42:21.717 --> 00:42:23.639
um but at the same time you

00:42:23.659 --> 00:42:24.260
know given the fact that we

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.501
are an applications company

00:42:25.922 --> 00:42:28.184
it's definitely um it's a

00:42:28.244 --> 00:42:30.385
multi uh you know it's a

00:42:30.405 --> 00:42:31.487
nuanced problem in terms of

00:42:31.827 --> 00:42:32.567
we want to build the best

00:42:32.586 --> 00:42:34.469
ui in a kind of application

00:42:34.489 --> 00:42:35.349
for the customer to

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:36.530
interact with these models

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:37.811
but again the large part of

00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:41.235
model output, to your point, is data.

00:42:41.335 --> 00:42:46.786
And so building the best

00:42:46.806 --> 00:42:48.269
data importers with the

00:42:48.289 --> 00:42:49.192
various ad networks

00:42:50.215 --> 00:42:52.597
to get the most recent,

00:42:52.657 --> 00:42:53.559
highest quality data,

00:42:53.978 --> 00:42:55.019
to get the best insights,

00:42:55.079 --> 00:42:57.422
to generate the content is

00:42:58.302 --> 00:43:00.005
a big part of what

00:43:00.025 --> 00:43:00.965
differentiates us from some

00:43:00.985 --> 00:43:02.246
of these other generative AI tools.

00:43:02.327 --> 00:43:03.527
Most generative AI tools are not,

00:43:03.949 --> 00:43:04.869
the content generation is

00:43:04.909 --> 00:43:06.050
not powered by insights

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:07.931
from consumer data.

00:43:08.833 --> 00:43:10.074
So we have directly plugged

00:43:10.114 --> 00:43:10.735
in with the ad network,

00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:12.496
so we know what's driving clicks.

00:43:13.356 --> 00:43:15.057
What's driving your return

00:43:15.077 --> 00:43:16.699
on ad spend or the ROI?

00:43:16.798 --> 00:43:17.619
What's driving engagement?

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.061
And then we use this data to

00:43:19.101 --> 00:43:20.061
then power the content.

00:43:20.621 --> 00:43:23.903
And that is what makes us unique.

00:43:23.963 --> 00:43:25.385
And part of, I think,

00:43:25.485 --> 00:43:27.086
what creates the moat for

00:43:27.106 --> 00:43:28.306
our business is that unique

00:43:28.327 --> 00:43:29.327
proprietary data we get

00:43:29.447 --> 00:43:30.489
through these ad networks

00:43:32.791 --> 00:43:33.931
so that we can create more relevant,

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.833
personalized content than, say,

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:38.193
some image generation tool

00:43:38.213 --> 00:43:39.014
that you just kind of prompt.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.300
Is there,

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.400
maybe this is getting too deep in

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:45.721
the weeds.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.661
Is there like a huge

00:43:47.262 --> 00:43:49.362
overhead cost and the spend

00:43:49.422 --> 00:43:51.563
for utilizing the models

00:43:51.603 --> 00:43:53.003
and running them compared to say,

00:43:53.945 --> 00:43:55.204
running an application for

00:43:55.244 --> 00:43:57.346
customers that isn't so

00:43:58.367 --> 00:44:00.887
coupled to running a giant

00:44:01.228 --> 00:44:04.128
ten gigabyte plus model and

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:05.869
retraining it for GPUs?

00:44:05.969 --> 00:44:06.469
Or is there like,

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:07.570
is it just mostly overhead?

00:44:07.951 --> 00:44:08.590
And after that,

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:09.672
after the model's been trained,

00:44:10.331 --> 00:44:11.893
the inference is much cheaper.

00:44:15.505 --> 00:44:15.585
Yeah.

00:44:15.605 --> 00:44:15.764
I mean,

00:44:15.784 --> 00:44:16.545
there's definitely kind of a

00:44:16.605 --> 00:44:18.126
scaling cost based on usage.

00:44:19.027 --> 00:44:22.708
But the inference costs and

00:44:22.728 --> 00:44:23.369
the training costs are

00:44:23.389 --> 00:44:24.429
getting cheaper every single day.

00:44:24.971 --> 00:44:28.813
So I would not say that that's, I mean,

00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:30.273
I think it's definitely a

00:44:30.313 --> 00:44:31.554
sizable chunk of kind of, say,

00:44:31.594 --> 00:44:34.996
our cloud spend is things

00:44:35.036 --> 00:44:36.197
related to hosting these

00:44:36.217 --> 00:44:36.858
models and training these

00:44:36.878 --> 00:44:38.298
models and serving these models.

00:44:42.798 --> 00:44:43.659
But also those costs are

00:44:43.679 --> 00:44:45.981
going down and our margins are, you know,

00:44:46.041 --> 00:44:47.681
ultimately, you know,

00:44:47.702 --> 00:44:48.822
for us and for most

00:44:48.862 --> 00:44:49.702
applications companies,

00:44:49.802 --> 00:44:50.563
what is the problem you're

00:44:50.583 --> 00:44:51.344
solving for that customer?

00:44:51.364 --> 00:44:52.344
What is the value providing?

00:44:52.664 --> 00:44:53.065
And for us,

00:44:53.105 --> 00:44:55.166
it's automated creative generation,

00:44:55.766 --> 00:44:56.847
scaling creative generation, you know,

00:44:58.088 --> 00:44:59.710
and that value providing is

00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:01.231
substantially larger than

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:04.152
the cost it takes to, you know,

00:45:04.192 --> 00:45:05.092
do inference or do training.

00:45:06.195 --> 00:45:07.416
Yeah, I mean, I totally get it.

00:45:07.456 --> 00:45:08.396
I think one of the things

00:45:08.476 --> 00:45:09.556
that's coming up in the

00:45:09.615 --> 00:45:10.956
future is the realization

00:45:10.976 --> 00:45:12.458
that we need smaller models

00:45:12.478 --> 00:45:13.318
that are more focused,

00:45:13.338 --> 00:45:14.257
that are working together

00:45:14.298 --> 00:45:16.079
with some sort of oversight

00:45:16.318 --> 00:45:18.079
that drives which model is

00:45:18.139 --> 00:45:19.420
being utilized and how that

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.041
model is being utilized effectively.

00:45:21.862 --> 00:45:22.601
Are you already at that

00:45:22.661 --> 00:45:24.163
stage where you have

00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:25.302
multiple models that are

00:45:25.342 --> 00:45:26.744
being selected dynamically

00:45:26.903 --> 00:45:28.684
or a model to choose other models?

00:45:28.704 --> 00:45:28.925
Yeah, we do.

00:45:28.945 --> 00:45:29.644
Yeah, we have a model router.

00:45:31.925 --> 00:45:32.726
we have a model router.

00:45:32.766 --> 00:45:33.507
So for example,

00:45:33.586 --> 00:45:36.349
if a customer wants to train clothes,

00:45:36.768 --> 00:45:37.588
that's different than

00:45:37.628 --> 00:45:38.769
trying to train other types

00:45:38.789 --> 00:45:39.210
of product photos.

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.951
Or if they're trying to

00:45:39.971 --> 00:45:41.152
generate hyper-realistic

00:45:41.192 --> 00:45:42.632
images of people wearing, say,

00:45:42.652 --> 00:45:44.713
because you're doing your

00:45:44.733 --> 00:45:45.373
clothing company and you

00:45:45.393 --> 00:45:46.014
have all these different

00:45:46.934 --> 00:45:48.335
skews related to clothing,

00:45:48.576 --> 00:45:49.436
there's a specific model

00:45:49.456 --> 00:45:50.036
that's really good at

00:45:50.077 --> 00:45:51.458
generating images for that

00:45:51.557 --> 00:45:52.498
circumstance versus, say,

00:45:52.958 --> 00:45:54.298
you're an events company

00:45:54.338 --> 00:45:55.159
and you're trying to

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.201
showcase a specific location.

00:45:58.601 --> 00:45:59.702
Or you're trying to...

00:46:01.001 --> 00:46:01.742
But you're really focused on

00:46:01.842 --> 00:46:03.384
utilizing a specific face

00:46:05.766 --> 00:46:06.686
that's in the image

00:46:06.766 --> 00:46:07.768
generated image or video.

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:09.931
Each one of these kind of

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:11.192
use cases has a distinct

00:46:11.231 --> 00:46:13.014
model that's the best for it.

00:46:13.175 --> 00:46:14.615
And so we do model routing

00:46:14.635 --> 00:46:15.617
on our end to make sure we

00:46:15.637 --> 00:46:16.438
deliver the best outcome

00:46:17.159 --> 00:46:17.940
for our customers.

00:46:18.422 --> 00:46:19.784
That makes sense.

00:46:20.324 --> 00:46:20.543
I mean,

00:46:20.784 --> 00:46:22.447
that right now I think is a huge

00:46:22.487 --> 00:46:23.527
innovation that a lot of

00:46:23.588 --> 00:46:25.510
companies aren't utilizing as much.

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:26.972
They're utilizing the one

00:46:26.992 --> 00:46:27.793
foundation model that's

00:46:27.813 --> 00:46:29.153
coming from one of the

00:46:29.173 --> 00:46:31.175
major model providers,

00:46:32.056 --> 00:46:33.159
or even if they're training it themselves,

00:46:33.179 --> 00:46:34.079
they still only have one.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.501
I'm sort of curious,

00:46:35.521 --> 00:46:36.260
what do you think is next

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:36.960
for the industry?

00:46:37.101 --> 00:46:38.302
Is there something specific

00:46:38.342 --> 00:46:39.463
that you already see as a

00:46:39.543 --> 00:46:41.704
huge challenge that needs

00:46:41.744 --> 00:46:43.605
to be overcome or something?

00:46:43.905 --> 00:46:44.766
I don't want you to spoil

00:46:44.806 --> 00:46:45.626
anything internally that

00:46:45.646 --> 00:46:46.226
you're working on,

00:46:46.585 --> 00:46:47.606
but maybe you see something

00:46:47.626 --> 00:46:48.547
that like the providers

00:46:48.588 --> 00:46:49.387
that you're utilizing,

00:46:49.547 --> 00:46:52.670
you want them to do.

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:53.909
Yeah, I mean, you see kind of, you know,

00:46:53.949 --> 00:46:55.070
these kind of middleware,

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:56.552
the rise of middleware and kind of like,

00:46:56.572 --> 00:46:57.231
you know, a lot of the

00:47:00.648 --> 00:47:01.068
the, you know,

00:47:01.088 --> 00:47:01.889
the layers between the

00:47:01.909 --> 00:47:02.871
foundation models and the

00:47:02.911 --> 00:47:05.413
orchestration that require, you know, go,

00:47:05.572 --> 00:47:05.793
you know,

00:47:05.873 --> 00:47:06.614
between orchestrating where

00:47:06.634 --> 00:47:08.275
these various models and, you know,

00:47:08.295 --> 00:47:09.436
the question is how

00:47:09.675 --> 00:47:10.737
defensible of a business it

00:47:10.777 --> 00:47:12.077
is in terms of building a

00:47:12.097 --> 00:47:12.518
business like this,

00:47:12.559 --> 00:47:13.539
because this space is

00:47:13.559 --> 00:47:15.681
moving so fast and you know, what, what's,

00:47:16.061 --> 00:47:16.681
you know,

00:47:16.722 --> 00:47:17.882
kind of an important service

00:47:17.902 --> 00:47:18.923
today may be completely

00:47:18.943 --> 00:47:19.565
integrated into one of

00:47:19.585 --> 00:47:20.364
these platforms tomorrow,

00:47:20.445 --> 00:47:21.306
or you're kind of

00:47:21.365 --> 00:47:22.367
commoditized based on some

00:47:22.387 --> 00:47:22.987
new innovation.

00:47:23.047 --> 00:47:23.967
And so, um,

00:47:24.389 --> 00:47:25.829
you're definitely kind of building on,

00:47:26.369 --> 00:47:26.951
you know,

00:47:26.971 --> 00:47:27.771
like shaking on something or

00:47:27.791 --> 00:47:28.791
like quickly moving ground.

00:47:29.492 --> 00:47:29.552
Um,

00:47:30.472 --> 00:47:32.594
So in terms of, you know, but yeah, I mean,

00:47:32.614 --> 00:47:34.416
I think there is, you know, and, you know,

00:47:34.436 --> 00:47:35.356
there are companies that

00:47:35.376 --> 00:47:36.438
are focused on model

00:47:36.498 --> 00:47:38.579
routing and like trying to

00:47:38.599 --> 00:47:40.601
find the best models, depending on, uh,

00:47:40.621 --> 00:47:42.461
and orchestrating the models,

00:47:42.481 --> 00:47:43.523
depending on what the need is.

00:47:44.505 --> 00:47:45.585
I think semantic standards

00:47:45.606 --> 00:47:47.086
there to be able to compare

00:47:47.407 --> 00:47:48.728
one model versus another one,

00:47:49.268 --> 00:47:50.268
know like fundamentally

00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:51.309
what the changes are, right?

00:47:51.369 --> 00:47:51.768
I mean, you can't,

00:47:51.909 --> 00:47:52.670
you may not be able to look

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:53.530
inside the black box as

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:54.090
you're building it,

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:55.070
but afterwards you could do

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:56.052
some sort of validation.

00:47:56.452 --> 00:47:57.612
And that validation process

00:47:58.293 --> 00:47:59.094
I think would be important

00:47:59.134 --> 00:48:00.293
in order to do the seamless

00:48:00.735 --> 00:48:02.715
swapping that we talked about earlier.

00:48:03.076 --> 00:48:03.516
Absolutely.

00:48:03.695 --> 00:48:04.597
I think a lot of it, you know,

00:48:04.617 --> 00:48:06.717
like testing and yeah, I mean,

00:48:06.737 --> 00:48:07.378
there's a lot of

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:12.393
There's value in human testing and all.

00:48:13.815 --> 00:48:15.637
There's reinforcement

00:48:15.677 --> 00:48:16.177
learning with human

00:48:16.197 --> 00:48:18.260
feedback is a big part of

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.802
what makes these models better and more.

00:48:20.202 --> 00:48:21.043
In order to do reinforcement

00:48:21.063 --> 00:48:21.923
learning with feedback,

00:48:21.943 --> 00:48:23.965
you need humans to provide feedback.

00:48:24.045 --> 00:48:24.967
There's a whole business

00:48:25.027 --> 00:48:26.708
associated with providing that.

00:48:27.909 --> 00:48:30.012
And so, yeah, I mean,

00:48:31.614 --> 00:48:32.414
you know we actually you

00:48:32.434 --> 00:48:33.594
mentioned earlier like uh

00:48:33.614 --> 00:48:34.375
you know the automation of

00:48:34.434 --> 00:48:35.295
jobs like there's going to

00:48:35.335 --> 00:48:36.635
be many new jobs associated

00:48:36.655 --> 00:48:37.335
with this technology

00:48:37.356 --> 00:48:38.436
because you know there's

00:48:38.476 --> 00:48:40.096
many new needs associated

00:48:40.115 --> 00:48:41.036
with new technologies like

00:48:41.056 --> 00:48:42.077
you know today I'm talking

00:48:42.097 --> 00:48:42.797
about digital marketing

00:48:42.876 --> 00:48:43.737
digital advertising I mean

00:48:43.757 --> 00:48:44.336
this wasn't even an

00:48:44.376 --> 00:48:45.898
industry uh you know thirty

00:48:45.978 --> 00:48:47.838
thirty years ago and so um

00:48:49.199 --> 00:48:51.338
um like you know new new

00:48:51.478 --> 00:48:52.840
spaces are gonna talk about

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:53.579
you know gonna create new

00:48:53.599 --> 00:48:55.039
opportunities uh and new

00:48:55.059 --> 00:48:57.561
industries uh and uh yeah

00:48:58.376 --> 00:48:59.496
they call me about people to

00:48:59.536 --> 00:49:00.918
where they're most most productive.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.742
I feel like I should, I should ask,

00:49:06.762 --> 00:49:07.523
you know, obviously,

00:49:07.543 --> 00:49:09.664
your product itself has AI

00:49:09.684 --> 00:49:11.105
written into it as the part

00:49:11.125 --> 00:49:12.065
of the value offering.

00:49:12.626 --> 00:49:13.827
Are you utilizing any of the

00:49:13.847 --> 00:49:15.128
tools that help with the

00:49:15.188 --> 00:49:16.409
development process or

00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:18.050
organizational management

00:49:18.391 --> 00:49:19.672
within your company that

00:49:19.731 --> 00:49:21.313
are AI tools in nature?

00:49:24.625 --> 00:49:25.306
Yeah,

00:49:25.666 --> 00:49:28.728
I think meeting summaries and meeting

00:49:28.768 --> 00:49:30.490
recorders that summarize meetings, I mean,

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.373
I definitely use these

00:49:33.414 --> 00:49:36.737
generative models for my emails,

00:49:36.936 --> 00:49:37.998
my product specs.

00:49:40.918 --> 00:49:42.980
writing blog posts, you know,

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.882
writing kind of documents.

00:49:44.902 --> 00:49:45.362
I mean,

00:49:45.422 --> 00:49:47.362
I think a large part of leadership

00:49:47.382 --> 00:49:49.625
is kind of, you know, communicating and,

00:49:49.804 --> 00:49:49.965
you know,

00:49:49.985 --> 00:49:52.286
writing documents and kind of

00:49:52.306 --> 00:49:54.387
aligning a strategy and

00:49:54.407 --> 00:49:55.347
soliciting feedback and

00:49:55.369 --> 00:49:56.568
kind of aligning in the same direction.

00:49:56.588 --> 00:49:57.869
So there's a lot of writing involved.

00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:00.472
And I definitely use the

00:50:00.492 --> 00:50:02.112
Jedi tools to help me with that.

00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:05.835
I use Jedi tools, you know,

00:50:05.974 --> 00:50:06.916
in Gemini Deep Research,

00:50:06.936 --> 00:50:08.297
really cool to do research,

00:50:08.356 --> 00:50:09.697
like competitive research, you know,

00:50:10.623 --> 00:50:11.722
know who are the leading

00:50:11.762 --> 00:50:13.222
companies in this space and

00:50:13.304 --> 00:50:13.764
you know what are the

00:50:13.804 --> 00:50:14.943
unique edges and you know

00:50:14.963 --> 00:50:15.923
what what is our unique

00:50:15.943 --> 00:50:16.844
advantage versus those

00:50:16.864 --> 00:50:17.784
companies you know create a

00:50:17.824 --> 00:50:18.824
chart for me that does this

00:50:18.844 --> 00:50:19.664
and write a report for me

00:50:20.184 --> 00:50:25.405
um and um yeah and I think

00:50:25.626 --> 00:50:27.045
our engineering team uses

00:50:27.126 --> 00:50:28.005
you know cursor and some of

00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:29.025
these other tools for like

00:50:29.045 --> 00:50:29.527
helping with their

00:50:29.606 --> 00:50:30.927
engineering and helping you

00:50:30.947 --> 00:50:31.987
know be more productive in

00:50:32.007 --> 00:50:36.547
terms of engineering um uh so yeah I mean

00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:39.061
There's AI kind of embedded

00:50:39.081 --> 00:50:40.722
throughout our application,

00:50:40.742 --> 00:50:42.041
but also internally as well.

00:50:42.061 --> 00:50:44.603
We're using AI to improve

00:50:44.623 --> 00:50:46.083
our productivity and do the

00:50:46.103 --> 00:50:49.684
work that maybe a couple years ago,

00:50:50.403 --> 00:50:51.545
ten times as a lot of people do,

00:50:51.684 --> 00:50:56.146
now can be done with more

00:50:56.186 --> 00:51:00.007
leverage due to these new AI tools.

00:51:00.047 --> 00:51:00.327
Cool.

00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:03.233
I'm right there with you on

00:51:03.253 --> 00:51:04.793
the meeting notes being generated.

00:51:04.893 --> 00:51:05.873
That might be like one of my

00:51:05.914 --> 00:51:07.375
favorite features of AI is

00:51:07.434 --> 00:51:08.255
not having to write those

00:51:08.275 --> 00:51:09.376
things myself anymore.

00:51:10.097 --> 00:51:10.918
Mostly because I never,

00:51:11.818 --> 00:51:13.498
it was like a constant problem for me.

00:51:14.739 --> 00:51:15.059
Yeah.

00:51:15.079 --> 00:51:15.880
I mean, gosh, like.

00:51:18.628 --> 00:51:20.047
We have all these customer success calls,

00:51:20.688 --> 00:51:21.509
and they're recorded.

00:51:23.369 --> 00:51:24.090
I'm not going to watch all

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:25.170
those video recordings,

00:51:25.269 --> 00:51:26.110
but I will read the meeting

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:29.891
notes of all our customer meetings.

00:51:30.851 --> 00:51:32.873
That's so much more doable now.

00:51:33.253 --> 00:51:34.652
People will actually write

00:51:34.733 --> 00:51:36.514
good summaries now about the meetings,

00:51:37.835 --> 00:51:39.394
and then now I can read

00:51:39.414 --> 00:51:40.635
them and read more of them,

00:51:40.936 --> 00:51:42.275
and I can make better decisions.

00:51:47.735 --> 00:51:48.735
So meeting summaries are

00:51:48.795 --> 00:51:53.338
such a powerful productivity tool.

00:51:53.358 --> 00:51:54.239
I just always find it

00:51:54.298 --> 00:51:56.579
interesting how the

00:51:56.599 --> 00:51:57.860
internals of a company who

00:51:58.161 --> 00:51:59.342
is innovating in the space

00:51:59.581 --> 00:52:01.123
is innovating internally as well.

00:52:02.023 --> 00:52:03.465
I see there's a lot of duality there.

00:52:03.505 --> 00:52:05.306
And I always question when I

00:52:05.326 --> 00:52:06.206
see a company that's trying

00:52:06.226 --> 00:52:07.987
to innovate in the product space.

00:52:08.608 --> 00:52:10.409
And they still have a very

00:52:10.469 --> 00:52:12.630
legacy or waterfall mindset internally.

00:52:12.791 --> 00:52:14.192
But it's really interesting.

00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:15.032
You said, oh,

00:52:15.072 --> 00:52:16.452
we are using all these tools in some way,

00:52:16.472 --> 00:52:17.273
or we're trying them out

00:52:17.313 --> 00:52:18.153
and seeing where the

00:52:18.173 --> 00:52:19.235
productivity boost is.

00:52:19.454 --> 00:52:19.974
That, I think,

00:52:20.014 --> 00:52:21.835
is a really great sign that

00:52:22.036 --> 00:52:23.436
it matches the mindset of

00:52:23.456 --> 00:52:25.699
what your product offers is

00:52:26.059 --> 00:52:27.360
matched internally with how

00:52:27.559 --> 00:52:28.460
you're thinking about the

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.960
culture of your team and

00:52:30.141 --> 00:52:32.282
the direction that you've set.

00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:33.655
Well, yeah,

00:52:34.175 --> 00:52:35.380
you say a really interesting point,

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.362
which is, for example,

00:52:36.402 --> 00:52:41.014
Amazon at AWS was on Oracle servers until,

00:52:41.054 --> 00:52:41.275
like,

00:52:42.233 --> 00:52:42.873
fairly recently,

00:52:43.072 --> 00:52:47.155
like the innovator sometimes is, you know,

00:52:47.195 --> 00:52:48.576
dependent on a legacy stack

00:52:48.596 --> 00:52:49.335
to do the innovation.

00:52:50.817 --> 00:52:51.737
And, and, you know,

00:52:51.757 --> 00:52:52.438
some of these legacy

00:52:52.478 --> 00:52:55.199
players have humongous, you know,

00:52:55.219 --> 00:52:55.559
lock in.

00:52:56.199 --> 00:52:58.059
And so, yeah, I mean,

00:52:58.099 --> 00:52:59.121
thankfully we have the

00:52:59.161 --> 00:53:00.300
benefit as being a startup.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.001
So we're building a lot of

00:53:01.021 --> 00:53:02.822
this infrastructure from scratch.

00:53:02.882 --> 00:53:04.443
And so we can pick the best tools,

00:53:05.063 --> 00:53:05.884
but once, you know,

00:53:05.903 --> 00:53:08.244
you have a team that's kind of, you know,

00:53:09.021 --> 00:53:10.081
like you built all this

00:53:10.101 --> 00:53:11.543
infrastructure around like

00:53:12.063 --> 00:53:14.643
a certain uh structure like

00:53:14.664 --> 00:53:15.643
just a certain set of you

00:53:15.704 --> 00:53:17.804
know tools it's really hard

00:53:17.844 --> 00:53:19.306
to kind of switch over and

00:53:19.326 --> 00:53:19.905
it's just a massive

00:53:19.925 --> 00:53:21.326
engineering effort and and

00:53:21.385 --> 00:53:22.726
so like I think this is

00:53:22.746 --> 00:53:23.327
really where I think the

00:53:23.347 --> 00:53:24.467
advantage there is

00:53:24.507 --> 00:53:25.168
advantage to being a

00:53:25.208 --> 00:53:26.487
startup today is because

00:53:26.507 --> 00:53:28.068
you kind of you know a

00:53:28.128 --> 00:53:29.068
company ultimately is you

00:53:29.088 --> 00:53:31.650
know is is just people and

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:32.530
the official organization

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:33.451
people to deliver

00:53:34.416 --> 00:53:35.737
you know, a superb product.

00:53:37.878 --> 00:53:41.101
And AI is all about, you know,

00:53:41.141 --> 00:53:43.623
people ultimately being more productive.

00:53:43.663 --> 00:53:46.105
And so we can reimagine

00:53:46.385 --> 00:53:49.266
corporate structures more radically,

00:53:49.827 --> 00:53:51.927
you know,

00:53:51.967 --> 00:53:53.528
and kind of this kind of

00:53:53.568 --> 00:53:54.170
original kind of

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:56.331
hierarchical org structure

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:58.211
may not make as much sense

00:53:58.231 --> 00:54:00.434
anymore as well with all

00:54:00.454 --> 00:54:01.715
these new capabilities that

00:54:01.735 --> 00:54:02.155
are available.

00:54:05.907 --> 00:54:09.449
Totally agree.

00:54:09.648 --> 00:54:14.050
Uh, Jillian, any last questions?

00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:17.552
She's, uh, well then, um, Hikari,

00:54:17.572 --> 00:54:18.012
maybe this is,

00:54:18.112 --> 00:54:18.851
if there's anything that

00:54:18.871 --> 00:54:19.773
you still wanted to share

00:54:19.793 --> 00:54:22.153
that you didn't have the chance to, um,

00:54:22.873 --> 00:54:24.313
now, now's your, now's your opportunity.

00:54:24.333 --> 00:54:24.454
Oh no.

00:54:24.474 --> 00:54:25.994
I mean, um,

00:54:26.414 --> 00:54:27.094
Thanks for the opportunity.

00:54:27.153 --> 00:54:27.655
And yeah,

00:54:27.675 --> 00:54:29.755
please sign up for a demo on our

00:54:29.795 --> 00:54:31.255
site on Mickey.com, please.

00:54:32.257 --> 00:54:33.916
I can also try the product out for free.

00:54:33.958 --> 00:54:36.878
And yeah, I mean,

00:54:36.898 --> 00:54:37.619
thanks so much for having me,

00:54:37.639 --> 00:54:38.199
Warren and Jillian.

00:54:38.219 --> 00:54:39.199
It was really a pleasure

00:54:39.219 --> 00:54:40.000
having this conversation with you.

00:54:40.059 --> 00:54:40.501
Well,

00:54:40.521 --> 00:54:42.240
then we still have to do our picks

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:43.021
for the episode.

00:54:43.942 --> 00:54:44.141
You know,

00:54:44.161 --> 00:54:45.583
can't leave those out or else

00:54:45.822 --> 00:54:47.304
Will will come back and complain.

00:54:47.603 --> 00:54:48.824
So Jillian,

00:54:48.844 --> 00:54:49.905
what did you bring for us today?

00:54:51.291 --> 00:54:52.931
I think since we're talking about AI,

00:54:52.972 --> 00:54:53.612
I'm going to do some

00:54:53.652 --> 00:54:54.972
shameless self-promotion.

00:54:55.152 --> 00:54:56.172
If you go to my website,

00:54:56.313 --> 00:54:58.574
dabbleofdevops.com slash AI,

00:54:59.193 --> 00:55:00.215
I'm putting the page back

00:55:00.295 --> 00:55:01.074
up and I'm going to just

00:55:01.114 --> 00:55:02.135
put a whole lot of

00:55:02.155 --> 00:55:04.596
disclaimers about how AI

00:55:04.936 --> 00:55:06.617
can't do absolutely everything for you.

00:55:06.637 --> 00:55:07.476
You do still need to have

00:55:07.516 --> 00:55:08.358
the human in the loop,

00:55:08.398 --> 00:55:09.217
like we were talking about.

00:55:09.237 --> 00:55:09.617
Like the Jillian.

00:55:09.697 --> 00:55:12.079
The Jillian's the human in the loop.

00:55:12.579 --> 00:55:13.820
I am quite often the human

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.400
in the loop and I have to

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:16.139
figure that out.

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:17.740
But that is another problem

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:18.920
for another day.

00:55:18.961 --> 00:55:20.041
But anyways, I have a tool.

00:55:20.856 --> 00:55:22.358
um that allows data science

00:55:22.378 --> 00:55:23.840
companies to have a

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.440
self-hosted kind of

00:55:25.521 --> 00:55:26.641
platform in which they can

00:55:26.681 --> 00:55:28.063
do a lot of data discovery

00:55:28.164 --> 00:55:29.925
I have a lot of data sets

00:55:29.945 --> 00:55:31.005
that are already up we have

00:55:31.146 --> 00:55:33.407
open targets we have some

00:55:33.467 --> 00:55:35.750
data from the single cell

00:55:35.809 --> 00:55:36.731
website that of course

00:55:36.771 --> 00:55:38.092
escapes me at the moment

00:55:38.293 --> 00:55:39.554
and a couple of other data

00:55:39.574 --> 00:55:40.894
sites some pubmed queries

00:55:40.934 --> 00:55:41.916
all that kind of thing so

00:55:41.956 --> 00:55:42.976
if you're a data science

00:55:43.016 --> 00:55:44.117
company you want to do some

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:47.101
Data Discovery with AI, sign up.

00:55:47.242 --> 00:55:48.922
It's all hosted on your infrastructure.

00:55:49.141 --> 00:55:50.742
I never see it and I never

00:55:50.782 --> 00:55:52.523
touch it unless you actually ask me to.

00:55:52.563 --> 00:55:53.784
That's awesome.

00:55:55.143 --> 00:55:55.864
We'll definitely check it out.

00:55:55.985 --> 00:55:56.945
We'll definitely check it out.

00:55:56.965 --> 00:55:58.865
So could you remind me what the URL is?

00:55:58.905 --> 00:56:00.626
It's dabble with... Okay,

00:56:00.686 --> 00:56:02.327
so I haven't actually put it back up,

00:56:02.347 --> 00:56:03.967
but I'll put it in the chat.

00:56:03.987 --> 00:56:04.827
But it will be up by the

00:56:04.867 --> 00:56:06.447
time the show is live.

00:56:06.947 --> 00:56:08.949
Because I had a bit of an issue where...

00:56:10.719 --> 00:56:11.541
I had a bit of an issue

00:56:11.561 --> 00:56:12.460
where people were signing

00:56:12.541 --> 00:56:13.742
up and they thought that it

00:56:13.782 --> 00:56:14.842
was going to do absolutely

00:56:14.882 --> 00:56:15.764
everything for them.

00:56:15.903 --> 00:56:18.065
And then I had some unhappy customers.

00:56:18.126 --> 00:56:19.146
And I don't like unhappy clients.

00:56:19.387 --> 00:56:19.527
Well,

00:56:19.567 --> 00:56:21.128
unhappy customers is better than no

00:56:21.168 --> 00:56:22.869
customers, though.

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:26.791
I mean, not in the long run.

00:56:26.811 --> 00:56:27.152
Not really.

00:56:27.172 --> 00:56:28.152
If you're going to start off

00:56:28.193 --> 00:56:29.114
with no customers,

00:56:29.153 --> 00:56:30.295
then it is to have unhappy

00:56:30.315 --> 00:56:31.235
customers who then tell

00:56:31.315 --> 00:56:33.077
other customers how unhappy they are.

00:56:33.516 --> 00:56:36.318
Brand identity and reputation is certainly,

00:56:36.498 --> 00:56:37.880
you know, very, very important.

00:56:38.519 --> 00:56:40.260
But, you know, I also say the, you know,

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.563
if you have no customers that, you know,

00:56:43.643 --> 00:56:45.063
getting some unhappy ones

00:56:45.523 --> 00:56:46.184
at least gives you some

00:56:46.224 --> 00:56:51.327
feedback on what you can improve.

00:56:51.347 --> 00:56:51.688
I know,

00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:52.327
but I got the feedback on what...

00:56:52.347 --> 00:56:53.608
The feedback was don't have

00:56:53.668 --> 00:56:54.610
the website up.

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:55.110
So you took it down.

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:55.289
Yeah,

00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:56.431
so I took it down until I could like

00:56:56.451 --> 00:57:00.072
work on the feedback a little bit.

00:57:01.456 --> 00:57:02.876
Anyways, people did that in school.

00:57:02.916 --> 00:57:03.597
They just thought that it

00:57:03.617 --> 00:57:06.101
would do more without

00:57:06.141 --> 00:57:07.481
another human than it did.

00:57:07.521 --> 00:57:08.282
But now they've got more

00:57:08.302 --> 00:57:09.784
data to pick that stuff up.

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:11.440
This is, I think,

00:57:11.501 --> 00:57:13.242
the fundamental challenge

00:57:13.262 --> 00:57:14.143
with the startups.

00:57:14.182 --> 00:57:15.684
You have to get out something complete.

00:57:15.844 --> 00:57:16.525
There's that famous quote,

00:57:16.545 --> 00:57:17.585
if you're not embarrassed

00:57:17.606 --> 00:57:18.166
by what you've launched,

00:57:18.186 --> 00:57:19.088
then you've launched too late.

00:57:19.507 --> 00:57:20.369
But at the same time,

00:57:20.728 --> 00:57:21.889
you have to focus on the customer.

00:57:21.949 --> 00:57:23.331
You have to focus on the ideal customer.

00:57:23.431 --> 00:57:24.431
You have to say no to

00:57:24.452 --> 00:57:26.994
certain customers that's

00:57:27.034 --> 00:57:28.195
not really the target

00:57:28.235 --> 00:57:29.077
customer at the moment.

00:57:30.016 --> 00:57:31.257
And so you do have to say no

00:57:31.278 --> 00:57:31.998
to customers as well.

00:57:32.059 --> 00:57:34.601
And so I think it's definitely,

00:57:34.802 --> 00:57:35.661
there isn't necessarily like a...

00:57:37.601 --> 00:57:39.264
a hard and fast answer in terms of like,

00:57:39.304 --> 00:57:39.483
you know,

00:57:41.585 --> 00:57:42.626
it's definitely kind of more

00:57:42.666 --> 00:57:44.728
related to your preference

00:57:44.768 --> 00:57:46.831
and dealing with angry

00:57:46.871 --> 00:57:47.771
customers or not angry

00:57:47.811 --> 00:57:49.954
customers and how you think

00:57:49.974 --> 00:57:50.594
about your brand.

00:57:50.614 --> 00:57:50.695
Yeah.

00:57:52.016 --> 00:57:52.956
No, I mean, I totally agree.

00:57:53.277 --> 00:57:55.018
The startup advice as build

00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:56.760
for what your ideal customer needs,

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:57.541
you know,

00:57:57.601 --> 00:57:58.782
is really what companies have to

00:57:58.802 --> 00:57:59.182
be doing.

00:57:59.302 --> 00:58:00.324
And I think that's been heard.

00:58:00.384 --> 00:58:01.105
I think the thing that

00:58:01.485 --> 00:58:02.445
now needs to be heard is

00:58:02.485 --> 00:58:03.266
that the people you're

00:58:03.286 --> 00:58:04.349
talking to may not be your

00:58:04.389 --> 00:58:05.429
ideal customer and your

00:58:05.469 --> 00:58:06.331
ideal customer may be

00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:07.592
someone that only exists

00:58:07.811 --> 00:58:08.873
months or years from now

00:58:08.934 --> 00:58:10.014
and it's okay to build for

00:58:10.054 --> 00:58:11.175
them but then you have to

00:58:11.235 --> 00:58:12.637
ignore advice from everyone

00:58:12.677 --> 00:58:13.639
else who isn't actually

00:58:13.659 --> 00:58:14.599
your customer because then

00:58:14.619 --> 00:58:16.481
you're not building for uh

00:58:16.523 --> 00:58:17.282
you know the future

00:58:17.483 --> 00:58:18.684
realistically okay yeah

00:58:18.704 --> 00:58:19.425
that's yeah absolutely um

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:23.579
Oh, thank you, Jillian.

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.061
My pick today is going to be

00:58:26.521 --> 00:58:27.681
Dune by Frank Herbert.

00:58:28.362 --> 00:58:29.103
I absolutely love the

00:58:29.123 --> 00:58:29.902
science fiction book.

00:58:30.023 --> 00:58:30.902
I think it was one of my

00:58:30.963 --> 00:58:32.744
first science fiction books that I read.

00:58:32.923 --> 00:58:35.425
And compared to other things,

00:58:35.465 --> 00:58:37.206
there's just such a level

00:58:37.425 --> 00:58:39.246
of attention to detail and

00:58:39.387 --> 00:58:41.108
innovation in writing about

00:58:41.168 --> 00:58:42.027
science fiction that I just

00:58:42.108 --> 00:58:43.889
don't think really existed

00:58:44.568 --> 00:58:45.449
before Frank Herbert.

00:58:45.469 --> 00:58:48.510
I'm going to go with this

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:50.510
book called Accelerando by Charles Frost.

00:58:52.764 --> 00:58:53.846
And it's really about the

00:58:53.885 --> 00:58:55.266
acceleration of human progress.

00:58:56.206 --> 00:58:57.027
And it's really interesting.

00:58:57.068 --> 00:58:58.208
Each chapter starts with the

00:58:58.248 --> 00:58:59.469
MIPS for humankind,

00:58:59.909 --> 00:59:01.269
like Million Instructions Per Second.

00:59:01.811 --> 00:59:04.893
And as AI advances, the MIPS,

00:59:04.992 --> 00:59:05.893
the collective MIPS of

00:59:05.992 --> 00:59:07.333
humankind also accelerates.

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:10.210
And initially,

00:59:10.371 --> 00:59:11.030
most of the million

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:11.751
instructions per second,

00:59:11.771 --> 00:59:12.711
a lot of it is human brains,

00:59:12.791 --> 00:59:13.532
human computation.

00:59:13.552 --> 00:59:14.731
But towards the end,

00:59:14.791 --> 00:59:18.813
it's mostly just AI and the

00:59:18.913 --> 00:59:19.853
massive compute power that

00:59:19.893 --> 00:59:20.273
AI is providing.

00:59:20.293 --> 00:59:21.753
But through this massive power,

00:59:22.213 --> 00:59:23.193
you're building Dyson

00:59:23.213 --> 00:59:24.853
spheres from the sun and

00:59:25.313 --> 00:59:26.534
just exploring the galaxies.

00:59:26.574 --> 00:59:28.715
And so I think it's a very

00:59:28.755 --> 00:59:30.755
optimistic book on what

00:59:30.815 --> 00:59:32.275
this technology can provide for us.

00:59:32.356 --> 00:59:36.336
And I do really like this book.

00:59:36.356 --> 00:59:36.896
That sounds neat.

00:59:36.916 --> 00:59:37.936
What's the name of the book again?

00:59:38.335 --> 00:59:45.199
It's called Accelerando.

00:59:45.219 --> 00:59:45.400
Cool.

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:45.480
Wow.

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:46.619
Then that's it for... Neuroscience and AI.

00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.460
This is what I'm here for.

00:59:48.862 --> 00:59:50.521
Well, you got it all in one episode.

00:59:50.702 --> 00:59:52.824
And I guess there'll be a

00:59:53.483 --> 00:59:54.905
segment of our audience

00:59:54.925 --> 00:59:56.646
that is just as happy for

00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:58.967
this episode as you have been, Jillian.

01:00:01.262 --> 01:00:02.744
Well, then that's everything.

01:00:03.063 --> 01:00:04.704
Thank you to our audience

01:00:04.724 --> 01:00:05.545
for attending and thank you

01:00:05.585 --> 01:00:08.007
to Hikari for being on this

01:00:08.068 --> 01:00:09.309
episode and sharing with us

01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:11.951
how Omnikey is innovating

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:14.112
in the AI advertising space.

01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:14.952
Thank you, Warren.

01:00:14.972 --> 01:00:16.273
Thank you, Joanne.

01:00:16.393 --> 01:00:16.873
Thank you.
