This week, Will and Warren sit down with Daniel Loreto, founder of [Jetify](https://www.jetify.com/), to discuss the ongoing challenges of setting up and maintaining development environments. From dependency hell to mismatched tool versions, Daniel shares how his team built DevBox, an open-source tool designed to simplify and speed up developer onboarding.

The discussion covers the pain points of local development, how Docker can be both a solution and a problem, and why many teams are turning to tools like Nix to create reproducible environments. They also explore how DevBox helps streamline workflows while avoiding the bloat of traditional containerized solutions.

Beyond development tooling, the conversation touches on AI-driven engineering, the future of ephemeral environments, and the importance of reducing friction in the development process. Whether youâ€™re a startup looking to scale quickly or a seasoned engineer tired of debugging environment issues, this episode is packed with insights.
