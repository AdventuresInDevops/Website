00:00:01.974 --> 00:00:02.274
Warren,

00:00:02.414 --> 00:00:03.875
welcome to another episode of

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:05.536
Adventures in DevOps.

00:00:05.577 --> 00:00:06.677
It feels like we were just here.

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:11.723
Warren, that was to you.

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:12.884
I know, you know,

00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:15.086
I just so thought that you

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:16.246
had something else lined up

00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:18.207
after that because in the past,

00:00:18.248 --> 00:00:19.609
sometimes you just keep on going.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.010
Right.

00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.013
Oh, so maybe I tend to ramble.

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:23.954
Yeah.

00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:26.155
That's fair.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:26.516
Yeah,

00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:29.018
it does happen to even the best of us

00:00:29.117 --> 00:00:30.678
once we get onto a topic

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.960
that really meets close to our hearts.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.761
And I feel like we have a

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.021
good one lined up for today.

00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:36.902
Dude,

00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:38.942
I am so excited about today because

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:40.503
we'll just cut to the chase

00:00:40.524 --> 00:00:41.865
because I'm sure everyone

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:43.706
on the podcast feed has

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:44.725
already seen the title.

00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:48.368
And joining us today is Kelsey Hightower.

00:00:48.508 --> 00:00:50.649
Kelsey, welcome to the show.

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:51.390
Happy to be here.

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.831
I'm so excited to have you here.

00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:55.072
So just to,

00:00:55.993 --> 00:00:57.334
I feel like you don't need an

00:00:57.393 --> 00:00:57.954
introduction,

00:00:57.993 --> 00:00:58.895
but I want to make sure that

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:00.195
everyone who's listening

00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:01.417
who may not know who you

00:01:01.597 --> 00:01:03.698
are is familiar with you.

00:01:03.738 --> 00:01:06.180
You're a software engineer, developer,

00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:06.921
advocate,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.183
and speaker most well-known for

00:01:09.283 --> 00:01:10.864
Kubernetes and your work

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.805
for open source and your

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:15.447
time spent at Google.

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:17.489
Is that a pretty fair assessment?

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:18.189
Yeah,

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:19.370
I think that's a good assessment of

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.990
the last mile.

00:01:20.822 --> 00:01:23.103
The last eight years of a

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:24.325
twenty five year career.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:25.504
You know, before that,

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.546
I used to work in enterprise IT,

00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:29.587
financial services,

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.129
praying to God that the

00:01:31.168 --> 00:01:33.051
Apache server doesn't fall

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.070
over in the middle of the night.

00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:39.034
I've worked in web hosting, tech support.

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:42.376
I've contributed to Python, Ansible,

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:43.317
Terraform.

00:01:43.817 --> 00:01:44.819
And so throughout my career,

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.040
I've had many of the roles

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.641
that I'm guessing a lot of

00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:48.621
your listeners have had.

00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:50.903
And I think maybe the thing

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:51.582
that maybe some of the

00:01:51.623 --> 00:01:52.584
listeners haven't done is

00:01:52.623 --> 00:01:53.444
that part where you start

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:55.344
to contribute to the tools

00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:56.546
that you use every day,

00:01:57.307 --> 00:01:58.167
the part where you actually

00:01:58.246 --> 00:01:59.147
join the community of

00:01:59.207 --> 00:02:01.009
people thinking about what comes next,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.349
thinking about not just

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.731
reporting the bugs, but fixing the bugs.

00:02:07.412 --> 00:02:08.051
And I think that's just

00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:09.233
brings balance to someone's

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:10.932
career where there becomes

00:02:10.953 --> 00:02:12.652
a lot of outward facing work.

00:02:13.114 --> 00:02:15.114
And you see that in form of conferences,

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:16.633
open source contributions,

00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:20.936
tweets on Twitter, those kind of things.

00:02:20.996 --> 00:02:21.156
Yeah,

00:02:21.195 --> 00:02:23.996
I think I talk with a lot of people

00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:26.437
getting started in their tech career,

00:02:26.576 --> 00:02:27.317
and I think that's one of

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:29.038
the things that a lot of them have.

00:02:29.912 --> 00:02:31.132
they struggle with is they

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:32.772
see someone like you in the

00:02:32.812 --> 00:02:34.592
last eight years of your

00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:36.052
career and they're like,

00:02:36.212 --> 00:02:37.294
how do I get there?

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:39.133
You know, and they're looking for,

00:02:39.213 --> 00:02:39.433
you know,

00:02:39.454 --> 00:02:41.973
they're searching Google job postings,

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:43.895
looking for Kelsey

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:45.134
Hightower's replacement.

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:46.735
And I'm like, no, you, you have to,

00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:48.015
you got to start at the

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:50.355
entry level and you, you,

00:02:50.415 --> 00:02:52.497
you sort of have to grind your way up.

00:02:52.796 --> 00:02:53.997
And I think that's, um,

00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:57.122
think that's somewhere along

00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:57.923
the way we've missed

00:02:57.943 --> 00:02:59.163
communicating that message

00:02:59.282 --> 00:03:02.084
over the last generation

00:03:02.104 --> 00:03:02.883
yeah I mean it's hard I

00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:03.943
mean when we watch things

00:03:03.963 --> 00:03:04.604
that are typically

00:03:04.644 --> 00:03:06.044
televised professional

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.085
sports you know they don't

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:08.164
televise the middle school

00:03:08.185 --> 00:03:10.385
games right they televise

00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:11.907
the pro games and so when

00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:12.926
you're watching the pros

00:03:13.106 --> 00:03:14.106
you know you're seeing

00:03:14.206 --> 00:03:16.568
twenty five year training

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:18.774
be perfected and then you're

00:03:18.794 --> 00:03:20.594
only seeing the one zero

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:22.435
zero one percent of all the

00:03:22.455 --> 00:03:23.795
people who've tried this do

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:24.855
it so what you're watching

00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:26.575
is the absolute pinnacle of

00:03:26.616 --> 00:03:28.176
that particular thing and I

00:03:28.197 --> 00:03:29.356
think it's okay to kind of

00:03:29.437 --> 00:03:31.217
observe those things and

00:03:31.237 --> 00:03:32.057
then people say hey what

00:03:32.098 --> 00:03:32.858
happens when you meet

00:03:32.897 --> 00:03:34.639
someone like that try to

00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:35.938
ask like how the how they

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:37.639
got to that point because

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.580
it's these little things

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.659
where I always encourage

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.300
people if you're on year one year five

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.942
Most people are trying to

00:03:44.082 --> 00:03:46.044
get to what they see on the

00:03:46.064 --> 00:03:47.568
screen that they don't pay

00:03:47.587 --> 00:03:48.889
attention to the nuance and

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.211
the detail like learning

00:03:50.252 --> 00:03:51.353
how to work with other people.

00:03:52.372 --> 00:03:53.332
Learning how to communicate

00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:54.372
to your manager that you

00:03:54.393 --> 00:03:55.493
don't feel challenged and

00:03:55.533 --> 00:03:56.775
you would like to do something more.

00:03:57.735 --> 00:03:59.176
Learning how the tools you use work.

00:03:59.217 --> 00:04:00.818
Oh, I'm just writing PHP.

00:04:00.858 --> 00:04:03.840
Like PHP is used by Facebook

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.681
in production.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.722
There are ways to make it faster.

00:04:06.842 --> 00:04:07.962
There are ways to build

00:04:08.103 --> 00:04:09.283
things like Shopify.

00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:10.805
Pay attention to the things

00:04:10.824 --> 00:04:11.705
that are in front of you.

00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:14.007
Don't race past that because

00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:15.448
I think what people end up with is

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:17.430
Those first five to ten

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:18.630
years almost throw away and

00:04:18.651 --> 00:04:21.271
they didn't really learn a lot.

00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:22.452
I met a guy that reached out

00:04:22.473 --> 00:04:23.072
for mentoring.

00:04:23.473 --> 00:04:24.053
He's like, hey,

00:04:24.173 --> 00:04:25.394
I'm trying to get to the next level.

00:04:25.935 --> 00:04:28.557
And he blamed everything on the job.

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:30.817
Oh, I'm only doing this.

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:32.740
These people are slow.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.100
They don't know what's going on.

00:04:35.882 --> 00:04:37.021
And I'm sitting here and I'm like,

00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:37.603
what do you do?

00:04:38.723 --> 00:04:39.062
He's like, well,

00:04:39.142 --> 00:04:40.024
I do a little bit of this.

00:04:40.064 --> 00:04:41.904
And he mentioned I manage

00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:43.045
the VMware environment.

00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:44.747
I said, oh, oh, this is great.

00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:46.348
You can definitely carry

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:47.569
that particular thing on to

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:48.129
the next thing.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.432
Why are they using VMs

00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:51.331
instead of bare metal?

00:04:51.812 --> 00:04:52.673
Couldn't answer the question.

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:55.675
I was like, oh, you haven't been learning.

00:04:56.475 --> 00:04:57.576
You've just been doing.

00:04:58.497 --> 00:04:59.098
You've gotten the

00:04:59.137 --> 00:05:00.278
instructions and you've

00:05:00.338 --> 00:05:01.399
mastered the instructions

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:03.240
so well that you think you

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.141
know how it works.

00:05:04.161 --> 00:05:05.062
I was like,

00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:06.002
what I want you to do is go

00:05:06.043 --> 00:05:06.663
back on Monday.

00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:08.723
And just ask a question.

00:05:09.122 --> 00:05:10.964
Why are we using VMs instead

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:11.584
of bare metal?

00:05:12.266 --> 00:05:13.427
Is there a performance overhead?

00:05:14.187 --> 00:05:15.708
When should you not use a VM?

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:18.129
Is there a security-related clause?

00:05:18.831 --> 00:05:20.271
How does Intel assist in this?

00:05:20.492 --> 00:05:21.932
There are so many levels to

00:05:21.973 --> 00:05:23.134
this that I promise you

00:05:23.894 --> 00:05:25.156
that you have not

00:05:25.295 --> 00:05:26.697
necessarily learned

00:05:26.757 --> 00:05:28.338
everything you can at the current job.

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:29.740
You just haven't been asking

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:30.600
the right questions.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.182
And so I always encourage people,

00:05:32.601 --> 00:05:33.483
slow down a little bit.

00:05:34.564 --> 00:05:36.245
Go deep before you move on.

00:05:38.396 --> 00:05:38.576
Yeah,

00:05:38.596 --> 00:05:40.898
and I think the attitude that you

00:05:40.937 --> 00:05:43.418
have makes a huge difference there.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.043
And instead of finding faults outside,

00:05:49.463 --> 00:05:51.045
Jocko Willink talks about this a lot,

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:51.365
you know,

00:05:51.805 --> 00:05:53.545
instead of finding faults outside,

00:05:53.947 --> 00:05:55.026
internalize it and say,

00:05:55.047 --> 00:05:56.687
what can I do to change this?

00:05:56.728 --> 00:05:57.209
Because really,

00:05:57.468 --> 00:05:59.410
I'm the only variable I

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.971
have control over.

00:06:01.831 --> 00:06:05.173
And it seems like that seems to be very,

00:06:05.213 --> 00:06:07.495
very effective for people long term.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.829
I always ask myself,

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.911
what do you attribute that to?

00:06:13.232 --> 00:06:14.432
Throughout like your childhood,

00:06:14.471 --> 00:06:15.892
when you grow up, you know,

00:06:15.932 --> 00:06:17.613
I was lucky I was born in any one.

00:06:17.673 --> 00:06:18.533
So I was part of a

00:06:18.574 --> 00:06:21.415
generation that played outside, you know,

00:06:21.475 --> 00:06:23.836
pre internet, pre smartphones.

00:06:24.797 --> 00:06:25.656
And going outside,

00:06:25.937 --> 00:06:27.637
you kind of do have to fend for yourself.

00:06:27.658 --> 00:06:29.879
You can't call mom, right?

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:30.819
You go play basketball in

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:31.639
the park and someone gives

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.240
you a hard foul.

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:33.060
There's no referee.

00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:36.035
There's no replay.

00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:37.036
There's no challenge.

00:06:37.735 --> 00:06:38.576
You just keep playing.

00:06:38.596 --> 00:06:39.458
You figure out what the

00:06:39.497 --> 00:06:40.338
boundaries are and you try

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:41.839
to stay in those particular lanes.

00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:43.982
My first job was at McDonald's.

00:06:44.742 --> 00:06:45.783
Now you can complain about

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.485
that and it doesn't make all that money,

00:06:47.524 --> 00:06:48.586
but you can actually go

00:06:48.646 --> 00:06:50.067
sweep the lobby with some

00:06:50.127 --> 00:06:52.009
integrity and do it to the

00:06:52.088 --> 00:06:53.971
highest level that you're capable of.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:54.891
And so,

00:06:54.971 --> 00:06:56.833
and I also played sports and also

00:06:56.872 --> 00:06:57.913
like it's a team,

00:06:58.754 --> 00:07:00.757
but the team expects you to do your part.

00:07:01.774 --> 00:07:02.975
And so I think there's a lot

00:07:03.016 --> 00:07:03.836
of this part of,

00:07:04.877 --> 00:07:06.319
what am I supposed to do?

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.279
And have I done what's

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.940
necessary in terms of preparation,

00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:11.663
showing up with the right attitude?

00:07:12.002 --> 00:07:13.223
I've learned that it's not

00:07:13.264 --> 00:07:14.245
always about being the best.

00:07:14.285 --> 00:07:15.365
Sometimes the best person

00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:16.586
with the wrong attitude is

00:07:16.627 --> 00:07:18.767
the person you don't want, right?

00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:19.569
Like you think about it,

00:07:19.588 --> 00:07:21.410
you need a surgery and your

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.172
surgeon has a bad attitude today.

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:26.379
I don't know if being the

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:28.079
best is all you need here.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.600
I need someone to stay focused.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.822
I want to make sure that I

00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:31.702
am the most important

00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:33.543
person in that room at that moment.

00:07:33.963 --> 00:07:35.365
That's the type of attitude I think,

00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:37.607
and it's hard to do this every day.

00:07:37.687 --> 00:07:39.088
If you've been at a job for six years,

00:07:40.358 --> 00:07:41.680
Is it easy to have the best

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:43.982
attitude in the world on

00:07:44.382 --> 00:07:45.682
six years and five months?

00:07:45.742 --> 00:07:49.146
It's hard to come in like it's day one.

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:50.906
But if you find yourself

00:07:50.927 --> 00:07:52.187
kind of too far off,

00:07:52.588 --> 00:07:53.908
then you've got to just ask yourself like,

00:07:53.928 --> 00:07:56.651
hey, is my attitude where it needs to be?

00:07:56.872 --> 00:07:57.391
And if not,

00:07:57.432 --> 00:07:58.432
maybe I do need to take a

00:07:58.473 --> 00:07:59.814
vacation and hit the reset button.

00:08:02.028 --> 00:08:02.428
Yeah, for sure.

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:03.389
And I think that's where

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:04.951
like a solid morning

00:08:04.992 --> 00:08:07.595
routine is helpful long term for that,

00:08:07.615 --> 00:08:07.795
you know,

00:08:07.834 --> 00:08:09.617
making sure that right off the bat,

00:08:09.637 --> 00:08:10.798
you're doing something that

00:08:10.838 --> 00:08:12.841
puts your mind in that

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.322
framework that you want to

00:08:14.362 --> 00:08:16.045
be because you can just

00:08:16.064 --> 00:08:18.326
kind of ride the waves and end up.

00:08:19.209 --> 00:08:20.009
however you,

00:08:20.449 --> 00:08:22.350
whatever mood you're in for the day,

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.252
or if you have a routine, like, oh,

00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:26.093
I'm going to listen to, you know,

00:08:26.132 --> 00:08:27.194
this particular piece of

00:08:27.254 --> 00:08:29.754
music or this motivational speech or do,

00:08:29.834 --> 00:08:30.315
you know,

00:08:30.355 --> 00:08:31.576
there's a thousand ways to do it,

00:08:31.875 --> 00:08:33.256
but you can actually direct

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:34.538
what kind of attitude

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:35.999
you're going to have during the day.

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:37.519
And I noticed personally,

00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:39.780
when I fall out of that routine,

00:08:39.941 --> 00:08:41.822
that it definitely shows up.

00:08:41.881 --> 00:08:43.523
And then I'm really

00:08:43.562 --> 00:08:44.344
fortunate to have a good

00:08:44.384 --> 00:08:45.464
set of friends who call me

00:08:45.543 --> 00:08:47.946
out on it and help me stay on track.

00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:50.777
I needed a reminder last week.

00:08:51.337 --> 00:08:52.399
I was given a keynote.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.681
And I mean,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.841
I don't think I put enough

00:08:55.881 --> 00:08:57.263
attention into the preparation.

00:08:57.283 --> 00:08:58.183
You know,

00:08:58.283 --> 00:08:59.985
I have a lot of tricks in my bag.

00:09:00.004 --> 00:09:00.926
I have lots of stories.

00:09:00.985 --> 00:09:02.187
I have a lot of go-tos.

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:04.870
But I was meaning to do some new stuff.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.471
And so I ended up holding

00:09:07.551 --> 00:09:08.390
off doing the new stuff

00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:10.370
until two days before.

00:09:10.432 --> 00:09:11.631
And so now I'm like, oh, man,

00:09:11.672 --> 00:09:13.672
I'm not putting my best foot forward.

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:15.373
I'm trying to compensate by

00:09:15.413 --> 00:09:16.653
doing unnatural things.

00:09:16.972 --> 00:09:18.313
Like, why am I adding all these slides?

00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:19.614
You don't even use slides.

00:09:20.214 --> 00:09:21.534
And I just have to remind myself.

00:09:21.654 --> 00:09:23.274
And it was a little different than, like,

00:09:23.294 --> 00:09:24.296
the motivational thing.

00:09:24.855 --> 00:09:25.875
I had to remind myself that

00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:27.876
I have put in the effort.

00:09:27.937 --> 00:09:29.797
This is not a two days of preparation.

00:09:30.256 --> 00:09:31.977
This has been a lifetime of preparation.

00:09:32.357 --> 00:09:33.119
And I remember saying to

00:09:33.158 --> 00:09:34.720
myself that morning as I

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.942
was deleting all this extra

00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:36.782
stuff that I didn't need,

00:09:37.342 --> 00:09:38.364
don't afraid to be great.

00:09:39.994 --> 00:09:40.594
You're good at this.

00:09:41.413 --> 00:09:42.735
Why are you so afraid of being great?

00:09:43.455 --> 00:09:44.735
Why are you overcompensating,

00:09:44.774 --> 00:09:46.196
trying to plan the whole thing out?

00:09:46.895 --> 00:09:47.535
Leave a room,

00:09:47.716 --> 00:09:49.495
leave a little room for just being great.

00:09:50.037 --> 00:09:52.057
Go on stage and have the

00:09:52.116 --> 00:09:52.956
confidence you need.

00:09:52.976 --> 00:09:53.957
And what I needed at that

00:09:54.018 --> 00:09:56.238
moment was just the confidence component.

00:09:56.738 --> 00:09:57.278
You think, hey,

00:09:57.298 --> 00:09:59.019
you've done lots of these keynotes.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:00.958
You should like no longer be

00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:01.740
fearful of the stage.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:02.759
I am.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.320
And sometimes I just need

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.200
that little confidence

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.020
boost because that's the

00:10:06.081 --> 00:10:06.801
difference between

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.701
A good talk for me and a

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.881
great talk for me is how I'm feeling.

00:10:10.961 --> 00:10:12.182
And so once I said that,

00:10:12.763 --> 00:10:13.783
I walked to the conference.

00:10:14.082 --> 00:10:15.423
I didn't know how I was going to open it,

00:10:15.923 --> 00:10:17.283
but I wasn't afraid of being great.

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:21.225
And it turned out great.

00:10:21.304 --> 00:10:21.865
Right on.

00:10:22.245 --> 00:10:22.625
Right on.

00:10:24.186 --> 00:10:27.586
So speaking of conferences and your career,

00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:29.607
you are recently retired.

00:10:30.488 --> 00:10:30.727
So...

00:10:32.489 --> 00:10:33.249
Congratulations.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.649
Does this mean that you're

00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:36.490
trading in the family car

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.273
for a golf cart moving out to Sun City,

00:10:38.312 --> 00:10:38.812
Arizona?

00:10:40.634 --> 00:10:41.433
The phrase I've heard the

00:10:41.494 --> 00:10:44.735
best is I'm retired, not tired.

00:10:47.378 --> 00:10:48.899
It doesn't mean that I just

00:10:48.918 --> 00:10:49.778
want to go off and do

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:51.721
nothing and sit by the beach.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.301
That's not it.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.741
What I realized is that

00:10:53.782 --> 00:10:54.562
there were lots of things

00:10:54.581 --> 00:10:56.102
that I like doing.

00:10:56.263 --> 00:10:58.764
I like building stuff.

00:11:00.443 --> 00:11:01.745
when it comes to technology,

00:11:01.904 --> 00:11:03.105
I love the delta between a

00:11:03.206 --> 00:11:05.067
project and a product.

00:11:06.089 --> 00:11:07.710
And then when it comes to public speaking,

00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:10.131
it's how I think out loud.

00:11:11.232 --> 00:11:11.393
Right?

00:11:11.413 --> 00:11:12.214
So I'm thinking about a

00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:13.434
bunch of things all the time,

00:11:13.495 --> 00:11:14.655
there are things that catch my eye,

00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:16.837
I have my own opinion, hopefully,

00:11:17.018 --> 00:11:18.278
it's an informed opinion.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.140
And then when I get a chance

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.022
to go on stage, I get to think out loud.

00:11:22.842 --> 00:11:24.024
And sometimes it causes

00:11:24.063 --> 00:11:25.164
other people to think I

00:11:25.225 --> 00:11:26.245
love those components.

00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:28.847
So when I retire in July of last year,

00:11:30.409 --> 00:11:32.331
One thing I kept were those things.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.152
So how do you do projects to products?

00:11:35.192 --> 00:11:35.412
Well,

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:38.553
advising companies like Docker and Vercel,

00:11:39.293 --> 00:11:40.815
companies behind Argo CD.

00:11:41.215 --> 00:11:44.157
These are all teams trying to go and say,

00:11:44.216 --> 00:11:45.917
hey, we got a great project.

00:11:46.378 --> 00:11:47.097
People like it.

00:11:47.717 --> 00:11:48.938
Can we build a business out

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.720
of this so it can be sustainable?

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.942
And so those elements I'm pretty good at.

00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:55.143
So when I can join the team

00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:56.764
and exist in that in any way,

00:11:57.364 --> 00:11:58.304
I can keep doing that.

00:11:58.804 --> 00:12:00.145
And the same goes for building things.

00:12:00.326 --> 00:12:02.226
These days, way less software,

00:12:02.787 --> 00:12:05.207
but more DUI home improvements.

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:06.668
And people are like,

00:12:06.688 --> 00:12:08.309
do you just buy like a brand new house?

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.051
Like, yes, it's a brand new house.

00:12:10.171 --> 00:12:11.312
First person to ever live in it.

00:12:11.912 --> 00:12:12.711
But there are parts of it

00:12:13.173 --> 00:12:14.192
that I think need to change.

00:12:14.712 --> 00:12:16.354
And so I started learning

00:12:16.453 --> 00:12:17.673
all the things just like

00:12:17.693 --> 00:12:18.575
you learn software,

00:12:18.815 --> 00:12:20.174
a bunch of YouTube videos.

00:12:20.475 --> 00:12:21.076
But there's one big

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:22.495
difference about software

00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:24.476
and like physical things.

00:12:25.216 --> 00:12:26.118
There are codes.

00:12:27.477 --> 00:12:28.458
There are compliance things

00:12:28.499 --> 00:12:29.239
you have to do.

00:12:29.278 --> 00:12:30.299
Like in software,

00:12:30.659 --> 00:12:32.421
you can take all the shortcuts you want.

00:12:32.581 --> 00:12:34.522
If it builds, so be it.

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:36.322
And the thing you live in

00:12:36.863 --> 00:12:38.364
that you expect to keep you safe,

00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:40.024
there are codes.

00:12:40.205 --> 00:12:42.326
And as someone who considers

00:12:42.365 --> 00:12:43.706
themself a software developer,

00:12:44.147 --> 00:12:45.607
some people will call it an engineer.

00:12:47.253 --> 00:12:50.375
Having guidelines really helps.

00:12:50.715 --> 00:12:51.575
Like when you're writing in

00:12:51.634 --> 00:12:52.596
a typed language,

00:12:52.956 --> 00:12:53.875
it tells you when you're

00:12:53.917 --> 00:12:55.517
passing around the wrong

00:12:55.576 --> 00:12:56.638
type between functions.

00:12:57.057 --> 00:12:58.139
Or you have a compiler that

00:12:58.178 --> 00:12:58.818
really understands what

00:12:58.839 --> 00:12:59.678
you're trying to do and it

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.940
yells at you when you're

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.860
not doing the right thing.

00:13:02.421 --> 00:13:03.682
Having building codes,

00:13:03.721 --> 00:13:04.542
if you can find them,

00:13:05.162 --> 00:13:06.383
is a really helpful way of

00:13:06.462 --> 00:13:08.083
guiding you into, oh,

00:13:08.624 --> 00:13:10.365
I should staple this Romix

00:13:10.404 --> 00:13:12.225
cable twelve inches before

00:13:12.245 --> 00:13:13.586
it goes into my electrical panel.

00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:15.187
Those things are important

00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:16.048
because there's a group of

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:17.528
people who do this professionally.

00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:19.389
They have taken time to

00:13:19.429 --> 00:13:20.451
write down these codes so

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.551
you don't burn your house down.

00:13:22.292 --> 00:13:22.851
So that's been an

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:24.253
interesting kind of pivot,

00:13:24.493 --> 00:13:27.335
but lots of carryover.

00:13:27.514 --> 00:13:27.894
Right on.

00:13:28.434 --> 00:13:29.995
So one thing you mentioned

00:13:30.035 --> 00:13:31.876
there that I thought was

00:13:31.937 --> 00:13:32.798
really cool was the

00:13:32.837 --> 00:13:33.677
difference between a

00:13:33.758 --> 00:13:35.139
project and a product.

00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:38.260
Because I've spent most of

00:13:38.301 --> 00:13:39.581
my career working with

00:13:39.682 --> 00:13:41.503
early stage startups, and I found that

00:13:42.642 --> 00:13:43.422
Like that's the difference.

00:13:43.442 --> 00:13:44.182
Like there's always a

00:13:44.222 --> 00:13:45.964
difference in successful

00:13:46.344 --> 00:13:47.563
startups that make it.

00:13:48.105 --> 00:13:50.466
There's always the product

00:13:50.686 --> 00:13:51.905
that you launch with and

00:13:51.926 --> 00:13:52.886
the product that your

00:13:52.947 --> 00:13:54.988
customers thought you launched with.

00:13:55.528 --> 00:13:57.589
And successful companies are

00:13:57.609 --> 00:13:59.210
able to identify that gap

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.451
and close it as quickly as possible.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:02.390
And I think that sort of

00:14:02.431 --> 00:14:03.172
resonates with the same

00:14:03.192 --> 00:14:03.932
thing that you were saying,

00:14:03.951 --> 00:14:04.631
the difference between a

00:14:04.731 --> 00:14:06.413
project and a product.

00:14:06.432 --> 00:14:07.874
You launch with a project

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.115
and you use that to build

00:14:10.154 --> 00:14:12.035
the product that your customers want.

00:14:14.573 --> 00:14:15.653
The hard part about this is

00:14:15.695 --> 00:14:19.275
that a spoon is a very useful tool.

00:14:19.716 --> 00:14:21.116
There's lots of value in a spoon.

00:14:21.876 --> 00:14:24.038
Almost every person in the

00:14:24.077 --> 00:14:26.599
world knows what a spoon is

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:27.278
or has used one.

00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:29.340
And so when you think about it,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.740
this should be an easy way

00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:33.042
to start a business around spoons,

00:14:33.721 --> 00:14:34.643
at least the first spoon.

00:14:35.322 --> 00:14:36.523
But you'll realize that a

00:14:36.562 --> 00:14:37.644
spoon is a feature.

00:14:38.888 --> 00:14:41.192
It is a feature of a kitchen

00:14:41.894 --> 00:14:43.879
or it requires all the other things,

00:14:43.938 --> 00:14:45.542
plates, forks, knives.

00:14:45.562 --> 00:14:47.046
So you got to sell a set,

00:14:47.206 --> 00:14:48.408
but everyone can sell a set.

00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:50.922
And so like there's not a lot of margin,

00:14:50.981 --> 00:14:52.322
maybe the materials you use,

00:14:52.363 --> 00:14:53.283
how fancy it is,

00:14:53.722 --> 00:14:55.543
but some people just want a spoon.

00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:57.764
And so spoons do well when

00:14:57.825 --> 00:15:00.486
sold alongside other things, right?

00:15:00.947 --> 00:15:01.767
You're probably better off

00:15:01.807 --> 00:15:03.467
selling your spoon in Ikea

00:15:03.908 --> 00:15:05.448
than starting a standalone

00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:07.769
brick and mortar spoon shop.

00:15:08.129 --> 00:15:08.890
It's not going to work.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.832
There's a lot of value in a spoon.

00:15:11.373 --> 00:15:13.075
You can go and do research and say,

00:15:13.716 --> 00:15:14.777
thirty four percent of the

00:15:14.797 --> 00:15:15.878
world uses a spoon.

00:15:16.097 --> 00:15:16.658
Doesn't matter.

00:15:17.058 --> 00:15:18.500
You will not be a standalone

00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:20.462
business selling spoons.

00:15:21.183 --> 00:15:22.706
And I think startups have the same thing.

00:15:23.866 --> 00:15:25.788
You give away software the

00:15:25.889 --> 00:15:27.510
lowest price point possible.

00:15:28.458 --> 00:15:29.460
on open source and it's

00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:30.539
pretty good it solves a

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.581
need that's why you built

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.902
it especially the ones that

00:15:33.942 --> 00:15:34.881
come from like someone

00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:36.342
using in production at a

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:37.982
real company and then they

00:15:38.023 --> 00:15:39.464
decide to open source it

00:15:39.923 --> 00:15:40.904
all the kinks have worked

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:41.985
out they've done all the

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:42.785
right things to get into

00:15:42.826 --> 00:15:44.265
production but then they

00:15:44.306 --> 00:15:47.067
give it away lots of things

00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:50.269
sell quote unquote if you

00:15:50.308 --> 00:15:52.029
gave them away like

00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:53.994
even cars you don't like if

00:15:54.014 --> 00:15:55.434
they gave them away they

00:15:55.475 --> 00:15:56.716
would be the best selling

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:58.557
cars in the world because

00:15:58.577 --> 00:16:00.219
they're free and a lot of

00:16:00.239 --> 00:16:01.559
people confuse the ability

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.841
to give something away for

00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:05.003
the ability to sell

00:16:05.082 --> 00:16:06.583
something and they're not

00:16:06.624 --> 00:16:08.405
remotely the same thing and

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:09.386
the teams look very

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:10.687
different so when you just

00:16:10.707 --> 00:16:12.448
have a great project you

00:16:12.469 --> 00:16:14.250
can over index on technical people

00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:16.094
Ideally,

00:16:16.114 --> 00:16:17.376
those technical people know how to

00:16:17.456 --> 00:16:18.438
interact with the community,

00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:20.503
but even then, that's not required.

00:16:20.643 --> 00:16:22.788
If it just works well, like grep,

00:16:23.428 --> 00:16:24.610
I don't know who maintains grep.

00:16:27.042 --> 00:16:27.822
Grep just works.

00:16:28.663 --> 00:16:30.643
And so I don't know who the

00:16:30.682 --> 00:16:32.464
product manager is, if there is one.

00:16:32.943 --> 00:16:33.984
But the moment you want to

00:16:34.024 --> 00:16:36.445
start charging money and

00:16:36.465 --> 00:16:37.525
you expect people to pay,

00:16:38.426 --> 00:16:39.306
now you got to start

00:16:40.005 --> 00:16:41.006
talking to customers.

00:16:41.547 --> 00:16:42.726
And customers usually want

00:16:42.767 --> 00:16:44.107
things like integrations,

00:16:44.227 --> 00:16:46.428
FedRAMP compliance, SSO,

00:16:46.668 --> 00:16:48.109
all of these things that

00:16:48.249 --> 00:16:49.789
technically your project doesn't need.

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:51.451
but your customers do.

00:16:51.811 --> 00:16:53.171
So helping people go from

00:16:53.772 --> 00:16:55.873
project to product is that

00:16:55.913 --> 00:16:57.453
kind of delta building real

00:16:57.494 --> 00:16:58.374
rounded teams.

00:16:59.134 --> 00:17:00.355
One thing I noticed a lot is

00:17:00.495 --> 00:17:01.556
a lot of founders struggle

00:17:01.735 --> 00:17:04.196
with the story.

00:17:04.237 --> 00:17:05.958
I have a cool new IDE.

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:07.538
I say great.

00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:08.740
Look at all the things that

00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:09.579
can do I say oh, that's,

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.621
that's beautiful.

00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:11.901
But here's the thing.

00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:14.883
People use Vim, Emacs and VS code.

00:17:16.259 --> 00:17:17.320
What is your story to them?

00:17:18.001 --> 00:17:19.143
Oh no, we're better than Vim,

00:17:19.303 --> 00:17:20.124
Emacs and VS Code,

00:17:20.144 --> 00:17:20.904
so you're not listening.

00:17:21.645 --> 00:17:22.846
Those things already work.

00:17:23.468 --> 00:17:24.229
They've been here,

00:17:24.249 --> 00:17:25.108
they have a great track

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.810
record and they have communities.

00:17:27.311 --> 00:17:28.313
Your thing is new.

00:17:28.993 --> 00:17:30.035
What is your story?

00:17:30.915 --> 00:17:33.018
And what I mean by story is,

00:17:33.858 --> 00:17:35.661
do you support Vim bindings?

00:17:36.874 --> 00:17:39.054
Can I import my VIM config

00:17:39.094 --> 00:17:40.315
that I spent three years

00:17:40.714 --> 00:17:41.615
getting just right?

00:17:41.835 --> 00:17:43.015
Or do I have to start over

00:17:43.494 --> 00:17:44.615
learning all your settings?

00:17:44.654 --> 00:17:46.096
These are the little nuances

00:17:46.695 --> 00:17:48.536
that go from project to product.

00:17:49.675 --> 00:17:52.856
Will is totally sold already on your IDE,

00:17:52.896 --> 00:17:53.997
and he already wants to buy

00:17:54.017 --> 00:17:55.696
it if he can import his VIM

00:17:55.777 --> 00:17:56.778
bindings right away.

00:17:56.817 --> 00:17:57.698
It's all he's been talking

00:17:57.738 --> 00:17:59.538
about for like the last six

00:17:59.617 --> 00:18:00.877
weeks is how much he wants

00:18:00.897 --> 00:18:02.259
to write code directly in

00:18:02.298 --> 00:18:03.578
production using his IDE.

00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:05.570
CICD, baby.

00:18:06.592 --> 00:18:08.212
Actually, I'm stuck on the spoons thing.

00:18:08.413 --> 00:18:09.932
I'm going to start a SaaS,

00:18:09.992 --> 00:18:11.173
spoons as a service.

00:18:12.193 --> 00:18:12.273
Well,

00:18:12.294 --> 00:18:13.855
it's really interesting because I

00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:14.654
think there was a very

00:18:14.674 --> 00:18:15.736
important embedded wisdom

00:18:15.776 --> 00:18:16.895
here that I feel like you

00:18:16.915 --> 00:18:18.376
just slightly highlighted

00:18:18.416 --> 00:18:19.657
and then moved on to the next thing.

00:18:19.718 --> 00:18:20.018
And that's,

00:18:20.498 --> 00:18:23.058
I bet there's a great desire to

00:18:23.138 --> 00:18:26.059
actually have spoons as a use case,

00:18:26.079 --> 00:18:26.180
right?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.280
You know, I want a spoon.

00:18:27.361 --> 00:18:28.721
And so your customers may be

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.481
even giving you this

00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:32.063
feedback about how great a spoon is, but

00:18:32.542 --> 00:18:34.104
If you aren't able to turn

00:18:34.124 --> 00:18:35.404
it into an actual product,

00:18:36.144 --> 00:18:37.085
everything around it,

00:18:37.165 --> 00:18:38.105
that feedback is actually

00:18:38.125 --> 00:18:38.685
what you shouldn't be

00:18:38.746 --> 00:18:39.646
listening to because

00:18:39.666 --> 00:18:41.248
there's no money to be made

00:18:41.347 --> 00:18:42.909
in that specific feature

00:18:42.929 --> 00:18:43.729
that you're offering.

00:18:43.868 --> 00:18:45.109
And so there's a difference

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.250
of whether or not you're

00:18:46.289 --> 00:18:47.230
listening to the users that

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.151
are able to help you make

00:18:48.171 --> 00:18:49.152
your company great or your

00:18:49.192 --> 00:18:50.392
product great and deliver

00:18:50.432 --> 00:18:51.333
to market and the ones that

00:18:51.353 --> 00:18:52.814
are just telling you the

00:18:53.054 --> 00:18:54.134
one little annoyance thing

00:18:54.153 --> 00:18:56.996
that they have and getting stuck on that.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.101
I think we're also getting

00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:00.301
to a point where everything

00:19:00.362 --> 00:19:01.663
doesn't need to be a product.

00:19:02.923 --> 00:19:04.566
And then people struggle with this, right?

00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:06.426
Because most people believe

00:19:06.467 --> 00:19:07.847
if you create some value,

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:09.230
there should be a path of

00:19:09.269 --> 00:19:10.951
getting rich from that value.

00:19:11.832 --> 00:19:13.792
And as much as I'm a capitalist,

00:19:13.834 --> 00:19:14.653
just like anyone else,

00:19:14.693 --> 00:19:15.434
don't get confused.

00:19:16.973 --> 00:19:18.855
But not everything is a product.

00:19:19.555 --> 00:19:20.555
Like think about like fruits

00:19:20.595 --> 00:19:21.134
and vegetables.

00:19:21.154 --> 00:19:22.435
Should all of those be products?

00:19:23.115 --> 00:19:24.115
Or should we still reserve

00:19:24.155 --> 00:19:26.896
the ability to grow them in

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:27.977
your backyard if you needed to?

00:19:28.938 --> 00:19:29.978
Should nature still be able

00:19:30.018 --> 00:19:31.498
to grow them where they naturally grow?

00:19:32.078 --> 00:19:32.959
Or should we just get rid of

00:19:32.999 --> 00:19:34.980
all of that and everything

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.119
is only accessible from the

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.700
grocery store?

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.160
That just wouldn't be good.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.961
And when it comes to open source,

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.361
it's the same situation.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.122
Some people will go and

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.442
solve a small problem and

00:19:45.462 --> 00:19:46.262
they'll put it on GitHub.

00:19:47.818 --> 00:19:49.300
And sometimes that's as far

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:49.941
as it should go.

00:19:50.882 --> 00:19:52.624
It should just be a thing on GitHub.

00:19:53.144 --> 00:19:54.025
It's a project.

00:19:54.266 --> 00:19:56.508
If someone really wants some features,

00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:58.108
they can pay a contractor

00:19:58.509 --> 00:19:59.651
to add the feature.

00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:01.873
Maybe they make some donations.

00:20:01.893 --> 00:20:04.435
I think let's encrypt is a great example.

00:20:05.805 --> 00:20:07.125
Y'all probably remember our

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:09.287
time where SSL certificates

00:20:09.686 --> 00:20:11.807
were high value products.

00:20:12.367 --> 00:20:13.788
Like you could pay VeriSign

00:20:14.169 --> 00:20:15.669
four hundred to twelve

00:20:15.689 --> 00:20:17.250
hundred dollars a year for

00:20:17.289 --> 00:20:18.391
an extended validate.

00:20:18.411 --> 00:20:18.891
I don't even know what

00:20:18.911 --> 00:20:20.352
extended validated means,

00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:22.051
but they would give you an

00:20:22.071 --> 00:20:24.012
SSL certificate that would

00:20:24.073 --> 00:20:25.413
expire like clockwork.

00:20:26.488 --> 00:20:27.388
And then you give them

00:20:27.429 --> 00:20:28.108
twelve hundred dollars

00:20:28.308 --> 00:20:30.911
again for the same certificate.

00:20:31.672 --> 00:20:32.452
And the difference between

00:20:32.472 --> 00:20:33.532
the one you make and the

00:20:33.573 --> 00:20:34.753
one that they make is that

00:20:34.773 --> 00:20:37.016
they signed it and people trust them.

00:20:37.056 --> 00:20:37.817
So in many ways,

00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:38.497
they were sharing their

00:20:38.517 --> 00:20:39.498
reputation with you.

00:20:40.479 --> 00:20:41.759
Zoom to where we are now.

00:20:42.579 --> 00:20:45.061
You have Let's Encrypt generating what?

00:20:45.823 --> 00:20:49.105
Almost half of all SSL certificates.

00:20:49.566 --> 00:20:50.866
Their reputation is high.

00:20:51.027 --> 00:20:51.886
They're built into every

00:20:51.926 --> 00:20:54.950
browser and is zero dollars cost to you.

00:20:55.733 --> 00:20:56.734
And it's a nonprofit,

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:58.736
so if you consider donating to something,

00:20:59.477 --> 00:21:00.758
Let's Encrypt is a good

00:21:00.798 --> 00:21:03.700
example of a project that

00:21:03.759 --> 00:21:05.260
doesn't need to become a product.

00:21:05.761 --> 00:21:06.643
And we should still try to

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:08.104
figure out how to fund those things,

00:21:08.503 --> 00:21:09.164
but it doesn't mean that

00:21:09.204 --> 00:21:10.305
they have to IPO.

00:21:10.705 --> 00:21:11.405
And I think that's a little

00:21:11.425 --> 00:21:12.926
bit more sustainable for

00:21:13.127 --> 00:21:14.828
most of the projects that are out there.

00:21:18.057 --> 00:21:19.157
I mean, I think that's a really good point,

00:21:19.298 --> 00:21:19.719
actually,

00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:21.038
because there's something very

00:21:22.098 --> 00:21:24.359
close to that in the same view.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.921
There's a BIMI certificate

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.161
to get your logo to show up

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.102
in emails and has almost no other value.

00:21:31.362 --> 00:21:32.403
And it's been trying to be

00:21:32.442 --> 00:21:34.343
sold like certificates of

00:21:34.522 --> 00:21:36.284
old for twelve hundred,

00:21:36.324 --> 00:21:37.344
fifteen hundred dollars

00:21:37.423 --> 00:21:39.265
just for your logo to show up there.

00:21:39.845 --> 00:21:40.565
and there's only two

00:21:40.605 --> 00:21:42.026
companies that offer it and

00:21:42.306 --> 00:21:43.247
people are complaining that

00:21:43.287 --> 00:21:44.126
let's encrypt you know

00:21:44.146 --> 00:21:46.327
isn't offering it yet uh

00:21:46.387 --> 00:21:47.848
it's so ridiculous honestly

00:21:47.888 --> 00:21:48.868
that some of these things

00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:50.910
have been uh productized

00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:53.790
and there is no way around

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.412
that I mean look if you can

00:21:56.491 --> 00:21:59.433
sell it more power to you

00:21:59.453 --> 00:22:00.433
but I don't think we should

00:22:00.513 --> 00:22:03.234
prohibit a let's encrypt

00:22:03.315 --> 00:22:04.776
like solution that shows up

00:22:05.736 --> 00:22:06.656
competes with it

00:22:07.442 --> 00:22:08.923
And then becomes the standard.

00:22:09.544 --> 00:22:10.644
And I think a lot of people

00:22:10.684 --> 00:22:11.746
are afraid of that, you know,

00:22:11.766 --> 00:22:13.646
and people say, you've copied my project.

00:22:13.686 --> 00:22:15.528
It's like, dude, you open sourced it.

00:22:16.048 --> 00:22:17.229
You chose a license that

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:18.249
said I could do that.

00:22:18.469 --> 00:22:21.471
I don't know how this is stealing or copy.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:21.711
Like,

00:22:22.051 --> 00:22:23.092
I thought that's what you wanted me

00:22:23.112 --> 00:22:26.554
to do.

00:22:26.614 --> 00:22:27.375
So one of the things I think

00:22:27.394 --> 00:22:28.295
would be really interesting

00:22:28.335 --> 00:22:30.977
to talk about is how

00:22:32.622 --> 00:22:33.521
You've obviously been very

00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:34.903
successful in your career,

00:22:34.942 --> 00:22:36.044
but that's only like one

00:22:36.084 --> 00:22:38.605
part of who you are as a human.

00:22:39.164 --> 00:22:40.506
So what did you do

00:22:40.546 --> 00:22:42.487
throughout your career to

00:22:42.586 --> 00:22:44.627
balance the professional

00:22:44.667 --> 00:22:46.388
side of Kelsey Hightower

00:22:46.429 --> 00:22:47.670
with the personal side?

00:22:49.069 --> 00:22:51.711
And specifically around how

00:22:51.731 --> 00:22:53.833
you maintain sanity and prevent burnout.

00:22:56.299 --> 00:22:56.619
Yeah, I mean,

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.240
I think I walked the burnout

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.722
line most of my career,

00:23:00.843 --> 00:23:02.363
but I think it feels different.

00:23:03.104 --> 00:23:04.204
When you put a lot of effort

00:23:04.244 --> 00:23:06.246
into something and you get

00:23:06.266 --> 00:23:07.086
the results you want,

00:23:07.346 --> 00:23:08.047
it's the same effort.

00:23:08.959 --> 00:23:10.720
it feels like man that that

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.560
was good I want to do it

00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:12.921
again so you probably need

00:23:12.961 --> 00:23:14.442
some rest but you're

00:23:14.481 --> 00:23:15.282
probably still working

00:23:15.323 --> 00:23:17.324
nights and weekends you're

00:23:17.344 --> 00:23:18.305
probably on call a little

00:23:18.345 --> 00:23:20.685
too much but if you do the

00:23:20.746 --> 00:23:22.686
same amount of effort and

00:23:22.707 --> 00:23:23.728
you don't get the outcomes

00:23:24.048 --> 00:23:24.627
like you don't get that

00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:25.608
promotion you don't get the

00:23:25.648 --> 00:23:28.090
raise it doesn't work I

00:23:28.111 --> 00:23:28.671
think that's what all the

00:23:28.711 --> 00:23:29.771
other emotions creep in

00:23:30.692 --> 00:23:30.932
Right.

00:23:31.092 --> 00:23:32.593
That that feeling sucks.

00:23:33.193 --> 00:23:34.594
And when you're tired and

00:23:34.634 --> 00:23:35.555
you have that feeling,

00:23:36.234 --> 00:23:38.517
it feels like burnout and

00:23:38.537 --> 00:23:39.376
they're dangerous because

00:23:39.396 --> 00:23:40.057
they're the same.

00:23:41.198 --> 00:23:41.999
And so for me,

00:23:42.398 --> 00:23:43.239
one thing I've done in my

00:23:43.278 --> 00:23:45.381
career is I kind of learned

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.102
how to set like a goal that

00:23:47.182 --> 00:23:48.863
meant something to me and

00:23:48.903 --> 00:23:50.022
not necessarily the company.

00:23:50.383 --> 00:23:52.265
So burnout would be I'm

00:23:52.285 --> 00:23:53.444
going to do all of this and

00:23:53.484 --> 00:23:54.306
hopefully I get promoted.

00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:56.626
And it turns out maybe

00:23:56.666 --> 00:23:57.587
because of politics,

00:23:58.362 --> 00:23:59.261
you don't get the promotion.

00:23:59.762 --> 00:24:00.702
And so you felt like the

00:24:00.722 --> 00:24:01.923
whole last three to four

00:24:01.982 --> 00:24:03.203
months was a waste of time.

00:24:04.203 --> 00:24:06.005
And you want to quit some of

00:24:06.025 --> 00:24:08.006
y'all rage quit unplug the keyboard.

00:24:08.326 --> 00:24:09.125
I don't know why.

00:24:09.165 --> 00:24:09.926
When you get to the office,

00:24:09.967 --> 00:24:11.307
you drive all the way to work.

00:24:11.747 --> 00:24:13.268
So you can quit in front of everybody.

00:24:14.028 --> 00:24:14.188
Right?

00:24:14.228 --> 00:24:15.608
Because that's how you feel.

00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:17.769
But when you kind of think about yourself,

00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:19.049
I started I don't know,

00:24:19.069 --> 00:24:19.891
maybe it's around year

00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:21.951
seven of my career.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:22.932
I started thinking like, yo,

00:24:24.152 --> 00:24:25.833
this job can fire me for any reason.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:28.971
This is not my family.

00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:30.471
And even they can kick me

00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:31.251
out for any reason.

00:24:32.212 --> 00:24:34.834
And so what skills do I need

00:24:35.394 --> 00:24:36.375
for the next gig?

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:37.974
So I'm going to always,

00:24:38.115 --> 00:24:40.715
just from my attitude and my ethics,

00:24:41.237 --> 00:24:42.497
I'm going to do as best of

00:24:42.517 --> 00:24:44.377
a job as I can with the current one.

00:24:45.301 --> 00:24:46.262
But if they're not teaching

00:24:46.303 --> 00:24:48.023
me the next set of skills I

00:24:48.064 --> 00:24:50.444
need to be successful, that's on me.

00:24:50.586 --> 00:24:51.685
And I'll give you a good example.

00:24:51.746 --> 00:24:53.207
In twenty twelve,

00:24:53.748 --> 00:24:55.209
I was working at Puppet Labs, right?

00:24:55.229 --> 00:24:56.209
So I was in a financial

00:24:56.229 --> 00:24:58.510
institution contributing to open source.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.491
I learned Ruby just so I can

00:25:00.551 --> 00:25:01.653
contribute to Puppet,

00:25:01.972 --> 00:25:03.253
the configuration management tool.

00:25:03.994 --> 00:25:05.394
I gave a talk at Puppet Conf.

00:25:05.476 --> 00:25:06.855
This is why public speaking is great.

00:25:07.676 --> 00:25:09.637
All of those open source contributions,

00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:11.720
you would never know my name.

00:25:11.759 --> 00:25:13.721
Given a talk at Puppet Conf,

00:25:14.201 --> 00:25:14.942
you know who I am.

00:25:15.902 --> 00:25:17.142
And so now people can see me.

00:25:17.823 --> 00:25:18.863
And while I was in town,

00:25:19.563 --> 00:25:20.723
I did an interview and I

00:25:20.743 --> 00:25:22.564
got a job at Public Labs.

00:25:23.263 --> 00:25:24.345
And I learned Ruby and those

00:25:24.365 --> 00:25:25.944
skills I was able to cash in on.

00:25:26.724 --> 00:25:30.007
Around a year, maybe a year and a half in,

00:25:30.106 --> 00:25:31.646
a new programming language emerges,

00:25:32.366 --> 00:25:32.926
Golang.

00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:35.067
And I'm looking at him like,

00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:36.188
why do we need another

00:25:36.228 --> 00:25:37.009
programming language?

00:25:37.028 --> 00:25:38.548
We got Python, we got Ruby.

00:25:39.048 --> 00:25:40.190
We have all of these things.

00:25:41.089 --> 00:25:41.710
And it was like, hey,

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:42.550
this thing's in the middle

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.271
between dynamic languages

00:25:44.372 --> 00:25:45.311
and things like C++.

00:25:45.471 --> 00:25:48.093
And at the time, I'm working on Puppet.

00:25:48.314 --> 00:25:49.614
And Puppet uses Ruby.

00:25:50.335 --> 00:25:52.214
And Ruby has a global lock interpreter.

00:25:52.576 --> 00:25:53.576
It can really start to have

00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:55.497
performance problems at a certain scale,

00:25:55.836 --> 00:25:56.678
even for something as

00:25:56.698 --> 00:25:58.178
simple as pulling

00:25:58.218 --> 00:25:59.538
configuration files down

00:25:59.578 --> 00:26:00.499
and trying to sync them

00:26:00.519 --> 00:26:01.559
across a set of nodes.

00:26:02.099 --> 00:26:03.000
And so we started moving

00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:05.701
towards the JVM using tools like Closure.

00:26:06.361 --> 00:26:08.281
But I saw this Go thing.

00:26:08.342 --> 00:26:09.241
And I was like, hmm,

00:26:09.281 --> 00:26:11.002
let me try it on one of our

00:26:11.042 --> 00:26:12.682
projects back there.

00:26:12.722 --> 00:26:13.624
Back there's a thing in

00:26:13.703 --> 00:26:14.804
Puppet Land that gets all

00:26:14.903 --> 00:26:16.124
the information about a

00:26:16.163 --> 00:26:18.365
node and sends it over to

00:26:18.384 --> 00:26:19.545
the main server so it can

00:26:19.605 --> 00:26:20.465
generate your configs.

00:26:20.486 --> 00:26:22.125
I was like, why is that in Ruby?

00:26:22.526 --> 00:26:25.106
Wouldn't it be faster and a single binary,

00:26:25.886 --> 00:26:27.428
nothing to install, not even Ruby?

00:26:28.347 --> 00:26:29.147
And I got it to work.

00:26:29.208 --> 00:26:29.988
I was like, yo,

00:26:30.147 --> 00:26:31.509
we might be able to solve

00:26:31.528 --> 00:26:33.509
our performance problem and

00:26:33.528 --> 00:26:34.868
we can ease installation.

00:26:35.869 --> 00:26:37.190
And I remember being like, yo,

00:26:37.309 --> 00:26:39.049
you can't use Go here

00:26:39.589 --> 00:26:41.631
because it doesn't run on Solaris or AIX.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:42.990
And I was like,

00:26:43.211 --> 00:26:44.371
what are you talking about?

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.291
Like, they'll get around to that,

00:26:47.332 --> 00:26:48.211
but I don't know if that's

00:26:48.632 --> 00:26:50.231
where the industry is going.

00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:52.653
We became an enterprise company.

00:26:53.252 --> 00:26:55.333
And then I remember Docker

00:26:55.353 --> 00:26:57.973
coming out and it was written in Go.

00:26:59.073 --> 00:27:00.074
And I'm sitting here like,

00:27:00.334 --> 00:27:02.635
I got a feeling that this

00:27:02.675 --> 00:27:03.497
is going somewhere.

00:27:04.157 --> 00:27:05.638
And then Terraform comes out.

00:27:06.079 --> 00:27:07.119
And I'm sitting here like,

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.701
what are we doing?

00:27:08.741 --> 00:27:09.803
We're not paying attention.

00:27:10.703 --> 00:27:11.744
Things are changing.

00:27:12.438 --> 00:27:13.858
And so I left Puppet Labs.

00:27:14.638 --> 00:27:15.799
I created a config

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:16.599
management tool called

00:27:16.619 --> 00:27:19.902
CompD using Go and etcd.

00:27:20.663 --> 00:27:22.584
And I went to the next space like, hey,

00:27:22.624 --> 00:27:24.144
this is the type of thing I want to do.

00:27:24.865 --> 00:27:26.306
And Go just paid off for me

00:27:26.385 --> 00:27:28.547
so much because then it

00:27:28.586 --> 00:27:30.827
became my on-ramp to CoreOS.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.260
And I had all the skills to

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.060
participate and develop and

00:27:35.181 --> 00:27:36.442
open source my own project,

00:27:36.961 --> 00:27:38.163
and then the roads lead to Google.

00:27:38.762 --> 00:27:39.663
And so just that little bit

00:27:39.702 --> 00:27:41.844
of planning of saying, I know where I am,

00:27:42.785 --> 00:27:43.845
but just investing on

00:27:43.884 --> 00:27:46.125
what's next and just making that personal,

00:27:46.586 --> 00:27:48.767
that became a big part of my career.

00:27:48.826 --> 00:27:50.948
So the balance was not there,

00:27:51.147 --> 00:27:52.548
just to be honest and transparent.

00:27:52.628 --> 00:27:53.990
I didn't figure out the

00:27:54.109 --> 00:27:55.911
family and work situation,

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.672
but I did believe that these skills

00:27:59.392 --> 00:28:01.012
would contribute to the

00:28:01.032 --> 00:28:02.073
future that I want.

00:28:02.653 --> 00:28:03.614
And so last year,

00:28:04.153 --> 00:28:07.135
I cashed in on all of those big bets.

00:28:08.175 --> 00:28:10.798
And me and my wife retired at forty two.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.080
And so it kind of feels like, yes,

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.182
I didn't have perfect

00:28:15.221 --> 00:28:16.982
balance the whole way through.

00:28:17.022 --> 00:28:18.903
There were times where I did

00:28:19.003 --> 00:28:20.444
take good vacations and got

00:28:20.505 --> 00:28:21.404
off right at five,

00:28:21.865 --> 00:28:22.625
but there were times where

00:28:22.645 --> 00:28:23.945
it was lots of nights and weekends.

00:28:24.707 --> 00:28:26.327
But when I turned to my wife

00:28:26.708 --> 00:28:28.449
in July of last year and said,

00:28:28.489 --> 00:28:29.189
was it worth it?

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:30.390
She said, yes,

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.171
because we both retired now.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:33.971
And so that's the way I thought about it.

00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:37.153
There's a long game component to this too.

00:28:37.193 --> 00:28:37.713
For sure.

00:28:37.834 --> 00:28:38.034
Yeah.

00:28:39.416 --> 00:28:40.557
Have you found since

00:28:40.637 --> 00:28:46.262
retiring that you have to

00:28:46.643 --> 00:28:48.805
struggle or that you're...

00:28:52.568 --> 00:28:54.811
undriven in how you spend your time?

00:28:54.872 --> 00:28:55.813
Cause it's like,

00:28:55.833 --> 00:28:56.614
I think a lot of people

00:28:56.794 --> 00:28:59.217
look at retirement as a, Oh, I'll wake up,

00:28:59.277 --> 00:29:01.940
play some golf, go hang out in the lounge,

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.621
you know, that, that type of thing.

00:29:03.661 --> 00:29:05.763
And, and I don't think that's realistic.

00:29:05.784 --> 00:29:07.445
I don't think that's sustainable.

00:29:07.925 --> 00:29:09.367
So have you found it

00:29:09.407 --> 00:29:10.749
difficult to occupy your

00:29:10.788 --> 00:29:11.891
time and keep yourself

00:29:12.191 --> 00:29:13.752
active mentally and physically?

00:29:15.303 --> 00:29:17.163
No, that's not at all.

00:29:17.984 --> 00:29:19.326
Because you know how we are.

00:29:20.506 --> 00:29:22.748
Hey, babe, I would like a bidet.

00:29:23.347 --> 00:29:24.308
Hmm.

00:29:24.348 --> 00:29:26.869
What is the best bidet in the world?

00:29:27.611 --> 00:29:27.830
Right?

00:29:27.871 --> 00:29:29.291
That's thirty hours right there.

00:29:29.352 --> 00:29:32.272
Just researching comments, Reddit posts.

00:29:33.054 --> 00:29:33.673
Oh, Toto.

00:29:33.953 --> 00:29:34.875
Oh, people like those.

00:29:35.154 --> 00:29:35.275
Hmm.

00:29:35.755 --> 00:29:36.875
When was Toto invented?

00:29:37.576 --> 00:29:38.436
How many have they sold?

00:29:39.116 --> 00:29:39.877
What's the history?

00:29:40.117 --> 00:29:41.077
Now I'm watching a Toto

00:29:41.138 --> 00:29:43.180
documentary on bidets.

00:29:44.974 --> 00:29:46.175
and how they were created,

00:29:46.195 --> 00:29:47.237
and how they were tested,

00:29:47.297 --> 00:29:49.018
and the engineering that goes into those.

00:29:49.038 --> 00:29:50.078
And I was like, well,

00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:52.160
I can't just buy a bidet

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.181
seat without a matching toilet.

00:29:55.362 --> 00:29:56.303
So now,

00:29:56.442 --> 00:29:58.443
I got to learn how to swap out all

00:29:58.483 --> 00:29:59.125
the toilets.

00:29:59.904 --> 00:30:00.566
What's the difference

00:30:00.605 --> 00:30:01.665
between one point six

00:30:01.705 --> 00:30:03.007
gallons per flush versus

00:30:03.086 --> 00:30:03.847
one point two eight?

00:30:04.407 --> 00:30:04.567
Oh,

00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:08.191
Washington state has a law that all new

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.412
toilets must be one point

00:30:09.451 --> 00:30:11.692
two eight gallons of flush

00:30:11.732 --> 00:30:12.673
for the climate efforts.

00:30:13.463 --> 00:30:15.404
So I'm now deep in this rabbit hole.

00:30:15.984 --> 00:30:17.946
I got three new toilets and

00:30:17.987 --> 00:30:18.926
three bidet seats,

00:30:19.646 --> 00:30:21.367
but they draw fourteen

00:30:22.148 --> 00:30:23.930
forty watts of power.

00:30:24.849 --> 00:30:26.270
You cannot put that on a

00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:28.471
normal electrical socket

00:30:28.792 --> 00:30:29.932
with your lights because

00:30:29.972 --> 00:30:30.814
the lights will flicker.

00:30:31.673 --> 00:30:32.473
If you do the math,

00:30:32.574 --> 00:30:34.095
fifteen times one twenty,

00:30:34.575 --> 00:30:35.295
that gives you about

00:30:35.455 --> 00:30:37.936
eighteen hundred watts of power.

00:30:38.356 --> 00:30:38.978
Didn't know that.

00:30:39.397 --> 00:30:40.659
So when you turn on the bidet seat,

00:30:41.219 --> 00:30:42.140
the lights will figure

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.000
because of the draw.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:43.840
And some of these lights are

00:30:43.861 --> 00:30:44.662
just sensitive.

00:30:45.122 --> 00:30:46.182
The breaker doesn't trip.

00:30:46.222 --> 00:30:47.384
So what do you need?

00:30:47.423 --> 00:30:48.683
You need more power.

00:30:48.865 --> 00:30:49.484
More importantly,

00:30:49.944 --> 00:30:51.086
you need dedicated power.

00:30:51.486 --> 00:30:52.846
So now I have holes in my

00:30:52.886 --> 00:30:54.468
garage ceiling because I'm

00:30:54.528 --> 00:30:56.650
running twenty amp circuits

00:30:57.309 --> 00:30:59.250
only after I learned how to

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.093
pull a permit from the county.

00:31:01.932 --> 00:31:05.074
I have no shortage of things to do.

00:31:05.773 --> 00:31:07.013
And I would say one other thing.

00:31:07.734 --> 00:31:09.055
I just started saying yes to everything.

00:31:10.295 --> 00:31:10.994
Do you want to go to my

00:31:11.035 --> 00:31:11.796
friend's birthday party?

00:31:11.816 --> 00:31:12.836
They'll be dancing and eating.

00:31:13.175 --> 00:31:15.316
I don't like to dance, but now, yes.

00:31:15.576 --> 00:31:16.576
And I'm going to dance anyway.

00:31:17.436 --> 00:31:18.977
And so it's a lot more yes

00:31:19.096 --> 00:31:20.157
to the people stuff.

00:31:20.877 --> 00:31:22.597
It's a lot more patience in

00:31:22.897 --> 00:31:24.979
who are these people.

00:31:25.019 --> 00:31:25.598
Talk to them.

00:31:25.838 --> 00:31:26.538
Be interested.

00:31:26.979 --> 00:31:28.079
There are other stories out

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:29.519
there that are not tech-related.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.020
And so I think I just

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.123
started opening up myself

00:31:32.242 --> 00:31:33.664
more to just more things.

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:34.726
Because you know how it is,

00:31:34.846 --> 00:31:36.028
when you work nine to five,

00:31:36.087 --> 00:31:36.969
that means someone else

00:31:36.989 --> 00:31:38.731
finds something to do with

00:31:38.751 --> 00:31:40.733
your time from nine to five,

00:31:40.753 --> 00:31:41.674
they figure out how to

00:31:41.756 --> 00:31:44.358
maximize their investment.

00:31:44.439 --> 00:31:45.359
All you have to do is,

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.222
can you not do the same?

00:31:48.976 --> 00:31:50.836
And so it's more of it's not

00:31:50.876 --> 00:31:51.938
about not working.

00:31:52.478 --> 00:31:53.558
It's more about working for

00:31:53.598 --> 00:31:55.058
yourself and having more

00:31:55.138 --> 00:31:57.980
time to work at being a good human,

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.701
being a good father, being a good husband,

00:32:01.063 --> 00:32:01.962
being a good all these

00:32:02.182 --> 00:32:04.324
other things that you're

00:32:04.344 --> 00:32:07.766
kind of on the hook for as well.

00:32:07.786 --> 00:32:08.467
What's been the most

00:32:08.507 --> 00:32:10.228
surprising thing that

00:32:10.248 --> 00:32:12.469
you've said yes to that?

00:32:12.489 --> 00:32:13.148
You were like, Oh,

00:32:13.169 --> 00:32:14.450
I didn't know I was gonna like that.

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:16.067
Honestly,

00:32:16.087 --> 00:32:17.570
it's going to be those parties

00:32:17.631 --> 00:32:18.353
where there's lots of

00:32:18.413 --> 00:32:19.895
dancing and getting... I

00:32:19.955 --> 00:32:20.958
hate getting dressed up.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.382
I don't like shirts with collars.

00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:26.468
I bought my first blazer a month ago.

00:32:27.607 --> 00:32:28.969
dressing up ain't my thing.

00:32:28.989 --> 00:32:30.230
It's like, oh, you got to go through this.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:31.811
What do you mean it has to match?

00:32:31.971 --> 00:32:34.355
Oh, my God.

00:32:34.994 --> 00:32:36.376
We're not going to the Met Gala.

00:32:36.396 --> 00:32:37.176
Like, why?

00:32:37.897 --> 00:32:38.739
We're just supposed to go to

00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:40.861
the birthday party, Chuck E. Cheese,

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.542
some coins for the machines, pizza,

00:32:43.824 --> 00:32:44.263
we're done.

00:32:44.443 --> 00:32:45.846
What's all this other stuff?

00:32:46.425 --> 00:32:47.346
And so you just say yes.

00:32:48.387 --> 00:32:50.670
And then you go and all

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.172
these people have different backgrounds.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.131
You listen to them.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:56.051
I like dancing.

00:32:56.071 --> 00:32:58.333
I used to dance a lot when I was younger.

00:32:59.212 --> 00:33:00.713
You can still have fun dancing.

00:33:00.973 --> 00:33:02.494
You don't need to be the best dancer.

00:33:02.875 --> 00:33:04.797
You can just be there and

00:33:04.836 --> 00:33:06.238
just enjoy and just be in

00:33:06.278 --> 00:33:08.159
the moment and not rush so much.

00:33:08.598 --> 00:33:10.720
So what I found is I like

00:33:10.779 --> 00:33:12.441
just going to these random

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.582
events as long as I have

00:33:14.622 --> 00:33:16.222
the time to just be there

00:33:16.503 --> 00:33:17.884
and not worried about some

00:33:18.003 --> 00:33:18.865
email piling up.

00:33:22.981 --> 00:33:24.463
or about getting power to

00:33:24.483 --> 00:33:26.945
the days yeah I like those

00:33:26.965 --> 00:33:31.990
too I feel like the flush

00:33:32.329 --> 00:33:33.290
followed by the lights

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.211
flickering that's sort of a

00:33:34.271 --> 00:33:35.153
special sort of uh

00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:39.297
experience yeah you're like

00:33:39.317 --> 00:33:40.297
what's wrong and then you

00:33:40.317 --> 00:33:42.720
start doing the research but I've been so

00:33:44.896 --> 00:33:44.977
Yeah,

00:33:44.997 --> 00:33:46.618
I think it's being important to know

00:33:46.659 --> 00:33:47.699
how these subsystems in

00:33:47.739 --> 00:33:48.700
your house work from the

00:33:48.759 --> 00:33:50.181
plumbing to the AC to the

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.742
electrical to how the Floyd Joyce align.

00:33:53.542 --> 00:33:55.003
And so my tool bag is

00:33:55.044 --> 00:33:56.285
getting pretty massive now

00:33:56.325 --> 00:33:58.787
as I'm collecting these random tools.

00:33:58.846 --> 00:33:59.787
But I don't know.

00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:00.528
I just kind of see it like

00:34:00.887 --> 00:34:02.348
my software and my tech career.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:04.871
The more tools you have,

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:06.152
the more problems you can

00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:07.051
solve when they come up.

00:34:07.432 --> 00:34:09.434
So this is just another investment for me.

00:34:10.344 --> 00:34:10.644
Yeah, I mean,

00:34:10.704 --> 00:34:11.706
it's pretty it's pretty

00:34:11.746 --> 00:34:13.027
related from my experience,

00:34:13.166 --> 00:34:14.248
having worked with and

00:34:14.347 --> 00:34:15.309
hired through a lot of

00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:17.190
people that how you operate

00:34:17.231 --> 00:34:17.831
in a professional

00:34:17.851 --> 00:34:19.251
environment is very similar

00:34:19.271 --> 00:34:20.672
to maybe your core values

00:34:21.213 --> 00:34:22.215
and how they come out in

00:34:22.235 --> 00:34:23.615
your personal life as well.

00:34:23.635 --> 00:34:23.936
So, I mean,

00:34:24.036 --> 00:34:25.177
obviously you've transitioned

00:34:25.657 --> 00:34:26.697
and you're still going out

00:34:26.918 --> 00:34:28.820
and looking into how to

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.739
solve these problems that

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:30.900
you're generating yourself,

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.322
but important to you in a

00:34:33.382 --> 00:34:34.184
similar way in which you

00:34:34.204 --> 00:34:37.347
did in your career.

00:34:37.427 --> 00:34:37.887
Absolutely.

00:34:39.996 --> 00:34:41.523
Home Depot, Lowe's, or other?

00:34:44.943 --> 00:34:45.543
Amazon,

00:34:45.704 --> 00:34:46.985
mainly because of the ability to

00:34:47.025 --> 00:34:47.945
select and choose.

00:34:49.565 --> 00:34:50.545
Maybe I just like the Home

00:34:50.585 --> 00:34:53.606
Depot color scheme to

00:34:53.666 --> 00:34:54.686
default to Home Depot.

00:34:55.686 --> 00:34:56.766
And I think Lowe's,

00:34:57.507 --> 00:34:59.108
if they carry the thing I want,

00:34:59.568 --> 00:35:00.547
I'm just going to buy it there.

00:35:00.608 --> 00:35:01.929
But honestly, you know how this works.

00:35:02.248 --> 00:35:03.748
There's always like a Lowe's

00:35:03.789 --> 00:35:04.748
and Home Depot across the

00:35:04.768 --> 00:35:05.610
street from each other.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:07.469
And my guess is wherever I

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.371
get off the freeway exit, whoever's first,

00:35:11.451 --> 00:35:11.891
you're winning.

00:35:14.581 --> 00:35:15.523
That's one of the things I

00:35:15.563 --> 00:35:17.365
do like about having the

00:35:17.405 --> 00:35:18.827
physical store close

00:35:18.947 --> 00:35:19.989
whenever it comes to tools

00:35:20.009 --> 00:35:22.030
is you can go in, you can pick it up,

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.731
feel it,

00:35:23.472 --> 00:35:24.755
and kind of get an idea for it

00:35:24.775 --> 00:35:25.755
that you don't really get

00:35:25.775 --> 00:35:26.717
that experience when

00:35:26.757 --> 00:35:28.159
shopping online for it.

00:35:29.146 --> 00:35:29.266
Now,

00:35:29.626 --> 00:35:32.268
I do try my best to go to my local

00:35:32.307 --> 00:35:32.949
hardware store.

00:35:32.989 --> 00:35:34.588
Like those little, you know,

00:35:34.688 --> 00:35:35.829
in your neighborhood,

00:35:36.369 --> 00:35:37.911
they have some obscure

00:35:37.971 --> 00:35:39.190
things that you need last

00:35:39.251 --> 00:35:40.351
minute and they're close by.

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:42.652
I try to give them as much

00:35:42.713 --> 00:35:43.713
money as possible when I'm

00:35:43.753 --> 00:35:45.233
buying this stuff because

00:35:45.253 --> 00:35:47.034
it's really convenient to have one close.

00:35:47.074 --> 00:35:48.315
You know how to drive, you know,

00:35:48.355 --> 00:35:49.695
five or ten minutes down the road.

00:35:50.335 --> 00:35:51.416
and some people further.

00:35:51.817 --> 00:35:53.318
And so those small businesses,

00:35:53.458 --> 00:35:54.458
they tend to be helpful.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:55.579
They tend to answer

00:35:55.619 --> 00:35:56.760
questions that other people

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:57.862
don't have time to answer.

00:35:58.702 --> 00:36:00.043
So I do try to support those

00:36:00.063 --> 00:36:04.567
local businesses as well.

00:36:04.606 --> 00:36:04.766
Yeah,

00:36:04.786 --> 00:36:07.208
there's a an Ace Hardware just near

00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.789
us here.

00:36:07.909 --> 00:36:09.431
And all the Ace Hardware is I guess,

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.913
are independently owned and operated.

00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:13.503
But you're right, you know,

00:36:13.523 --> 00:36:14.623
whenever we go in there,

00:36:15.182 --> 00:36:16.643
they're always like, hey,

00:36:16.684 --> 00:36:18.304
how did that last project turn out?

00:36:18.344 --> 00:36:18.543
You know,

00:36:18.563 --> 00:36:19.664
and you get this rapport with

00:36:19.704 --> 00:36:20.583
them where they're kind of

00:36:21.083 --> 00:36:22.005
they're kind of emotionally

00:36:22.065 --> 00:36:23.364
invested in whatever you're

00:36:23.405 --> 00:36:25.985
working on along with you, which is cool.

00:36:27.264 --> 00:36:27.865
Yeah,

00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:29.146
one of the biggest surprise and I

00:36:29.186 --> 00:36:29.905
know a lot of people

00:36:30.045 --> 00:36:31.286
probably think this should be normal.

00:36:31.985 --> 00:36:32.925
When I was going to like

00:36:32.965 --> 00:36:33.887
those trade stores,

00:36:33.927 --> 00:36:34.847
like where plumbers buy

00:36:34.887 --> 00:36:36.646
their equipment and, you know,

00:36:36.706 --> 00:36:37.987
wholesale various things.

00:36:38.766 --> 00:36:39.248
I walked in,

00:36:39.307 --> 00:36:41.628
I told the person my name once.

00:36:42.724 --> 00:36:43.606
Then I came back,

00:36:43.746 --> 00:36:44.945
and as soon as I walked in the store,

00:36:44.965 --> 00:36:45.646
he's like, hey, Kelsey.

00:36:45.666 --> 00:36:48.869
And I looked around like,

00:36:48.889 --> 00:36:51.849
you can't possibly know me from that.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.371
You just gave me a quote last time.

00:36:54.731 --> 00:36:57.893
And he made it a pride to say my name.

00:36:58.659 --> 00:36:59.460
And I just thought that was

00:36:59.501 --> 00:37:01.443
amazing that they pay that

00:37:01.503 --> 00:37:02.222
level of attention to

00:37:02.282 --> 00:37:03.364
detail because I think when

00:37:03.384 --> 00:37:05.226
you're selling what is

00:37:05.326 --> 00:37:06.586
arguably a huge commodity,

00:37:06.626 --> 00:37:07.708
they don't necessarily make

00:37:07.728 --> 00:37:08.429
any of this stuff.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.610
Any other store could sell this stuff.

00:37:11.211 --> 00:37:12.333
The level of customer

00:37:12.373 --> 00:37:13.914
service and the way they treat people,

00:37:14.275 --> 00:37:15.335
it's just a good reminder

00:37:15.396 --> 00:37:16.396
is that sometimes that

00:37:16.436 --> 00:37:17.878
makes all the difference.

00:37:20.369 --> 00:37:20.489
Yeah,

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.391
it's amazing how much something just

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.092
just remembering your name

00:37:24.192 --> 00:37:26.952
leaves such a favorable impression.

00:37:27.213 --> 00:37:28.534
I had a similar scenario

00:37:28.934 --> 00:37:29.954
about a month ago.

00:37:30.635 --> 00:37:32.496
I went to an irrigation supply store,

00:37:32.596 --> 00:37:34.577
didn't even know those things existed,

00:37:34.597 --> 00:37:35.177
but it's just like

00:37:35.717 --> 00:37:37.217
warehouse place that just had.

00:37:37.969 --> 00:37:39.170
irrigation you know the

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:40.371
sprinklers and the valves

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:41.711
and the manifolds and stuff

00:37:41.751 --> 00:37:42.632
and I go in and the lady

00:37:42.652 --> 00:37:44.873
that's working there I kind

00:37:44.914 --> 00:37:47.856
of butchered out in my best

00:37:48.036 --> 00:37:49.536
English what I was trying

00:37:49.577 --> 00:37:50.978
to do and she's like oh

00:37:51.018 --> 00:37:52.199
yeah she hands me this

00:37:52.259 --> 00:37:53.480
empty cardboard box and

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.440
it's like follow me you

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.320
know and takes me through

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.101
these aisles and she's

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.501
throwing shit in the box

00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:59.003
you know and just

00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:00.043
completely hooks me up and

00:38:00.063 --> 00:38:01.143
then I get back and start

00:38:01.164 --> 00:38:03.126
piecing all this stuff together and

00:38:04.277 --> 00:38:05.797
through that little bit of a description,

00:38:06.179 --> 00:38:08.119
she gave me everything that

00:38:08.179 --> 00:38:09.179
I needed to complete the

00:38:09.219 --> 00:38:10.920
project and nothing I didn't need.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.561
And I was like, wow, that is so cool.

00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:17.902
I mean, the DevOps folks listening,

00:38:18.001 --> 00:38:19.021
I don't think people

00:38:19.041 --> 00:38:20.001
understand you're also in

00:38:20.021 --> 00:38:21.322
the customer service business.

00:38:22.045 --> 00:38:22.184
Yeah,

00:38:22.224 --> 00:38:23.425
a lot of times I think people get

00:38:23.465 --> 00:38:24.467
very confused.

00:38:25.047 --> 00:38:26.228
You work at this company.

00:38:26.809 --> 00:38:28.010
This is how we do things.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:30.351
Look, maybe you're even open to new ideas.

00:38:30.411 --> 00:38:32.773
Maybe you're like doing this DevOps thing.

00:38:32.793 --> 00:38:33.554
But truth is,

00:38:34.034 --> 00:38:34.994
I don't think people realize

00:38:35.034 --> 00:38:36.155
that you're in the customer

00:38:36.195 --> 00:38:37.036
service business.

00:38:37.597 --> 00:38:38.817
When someone's trying to get

00:38:38.876 --> 00:38:39.838
something accomplished,

00:38:40.277 --> 00:38:41.458
typically they're doing it

00:38:41.478 --> 00:38:42.717
because it's the work.

00:38:42.818 --> 00:38:43.938
They didn't wake up one morning.

00:38:43.958 --> 00:38:44.719
It was like, you know what?

00:38:44.759 --> 00:38:45.998
I want to do a thing we don't need to do.

00:38:46.478 --> 00:38:48.460
Like they typically need to have it done.

00:38:49.159 --> 00:38:49.940
And if you could be like

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.041
that person that says,

00:38:51.121 --> 00:38:52.820
here's everything you need

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.322
because you learn your job so well.

00:38:56.481 --> 00:38:58.063
that you know that even

00:38:58.103 --> 00:38:59.143
though they didn't ask you,

00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:00.784
you're just making sure

00:39:00.804 --> 00:39:02.206
that they're set up for success.

00:39:02.626 --> 00:39:03.606
And that's where those kind of,

00:39:03.947 --> 00:39:04.266
I don't know,

00:39:04.286 --> 00:39:05.748
those getting started guides,

00:39:05.807 --> 00:39:08.789
those one button deploys,

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:10.050
all of these little things

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.831
we do just to make sure

00:39:11.851 --> 00:39:13.152
that people don't struggle

00:39:13.291 --> 00:39:14.512
or get in the way of the big job.

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:15.554
Because in your situation,

00:39:16.034 --> 00:39:17.815
you have a bigger problem

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:19.076
that you need to solve.

00:39:19.396 --> 00:39:20.836
I'm only coming to the store

00:39:21.297 --> 00:39:22.557
to get the tools so I can

00:39:22.617 --> 00:39:24.498
go back to the big problem.

00:39:27.228 --> 00:39:29.411
That's why I like referring to – go ahead,

00:39:29.452 --> 00:39:29.612
Warren.

00:39:30.123 --> 00:39:30.422
No,

00:39:30.543 --> 00:39:32.445
I'm so glad you didn't say like just so

00:39:32.465 --> 00:39:33.425
they could do their job,

00:39:33.445 --> 00:39:34.166
like just so that they

00:39:34.206 --> 00:39:35.786
could they didn't have to

00:39:35.847 --> 00:39:36.648
worry about this,

00:39:36.688 --> 00:39:38.568
because I feel like it's so

00:39:38.688 --> 00:39:39.590
often in the industry that

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.952
I hear anyone who's outside

00:39:41.992 --> 00:39:46.574
of doing on feature related work that, oh,

00:39:46.715 --> 00:39:48.695
I'm just here to make it so

00:39:48.735 --> 00:39:49.697
that no one has to focus

00:39:49.737 --> 00:39:50.858
about this area at all.

00:39:50.898 --> 00:39:52.018
But I think realistically,

00:39:52.898 --> 00:39:54.360
that's not what's super effective.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.260
And I think the you know,

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.601
the story about pulling out

00:39:56.681 --> 00:39:57.943
all of the parts for all

00:39:58.483 --> 00:40:00.425
water reclamation, etc.

00:40:00.644 --> 00:40:01.965
You have to know what's going on there.

00:40:01.985 --> 00:40:03.186
You have to be able to have

00:40:03.266 --> 00:40:04.288
a conversation and

00:40:04.327 --> 00:40:06.168
collaborate and give them what they need.

00:40:06.208 --> 00:40:07.469
But it goes both ways, right?

00:40:07.489 --> 00:40:07.670
You know,

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.391
they have the project idea in mind.

00:40:09.952 --> 00:40:11.032
You don't just hand them a

00:40:11.092 --> 00:40:11.932
one-click deploy.

00:40:12.172 --> 00:40:13.614
You know it's probably the right answer,

00:40:13.914 --> 00:40:14.434
but there is some

00:40:14.494 --> 00:40:15.356
conversation about what

00:40:15.376 --> 00:40:16.836
you're working on to

00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:17.697
actually even make that

00:40:17.737 --> 00:40:21.019
recommendation in the first place.

00:40:21.179 --> 00:40:21.260
Yeah,

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.721
I wanted to add that that's why I

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.623
like referring to DevOps as

00:40:24.643 --> 00:40:26.224
a trade so much because it...

00:40:27.318 --> 00:40:29.601
It mentally, I associate that with,

00:40:30.061 --> 00:40:30.222
you know,

00:40:30.262 --> 00:40:33.384
electrician or a plumber or a carpenter.

00:40:33.905 --> 00:40:36.646
And it's a, you know, a skills,

00:40:36.847 --> 00:40:37.907
a skilled trade.

00:40:38.367 --> 00:40:39.349
And it makes me think of

00:40:39.369 --> 00:40:40.250
someone who's gone through

00:40:40.269 --> 00:40:41.791
the ranks of apprentice to

00:40:41.871 --> 00:40:43.271
journeyman and taken the

00:40:43.331 --> 00:40:44.733
time and effort to master

00:40:44.753 --> 00:40:46.295
that trade so that they

00:40:46.355 --> 00:40:47.775
know the ins and outs of it.

00:40:48.115 --> 00:40:50.018
And they know which tools to

00:40:50.277 --> 00:40:52.039
use to help you successful

00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:52.900
in whatever it is you're

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.900
trying to accomplish.

00:40:55.489 --> 00:40:56.829
I like this analogy a lot

00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:58.130
because that was kind of

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:00.711
always my hang up with just

00:41:00.751 --> 00:41:01.632
the word DevOps.

00:41:02.692 --> 00:41:03.831
You can just use the title,

00:41:04.393 --> 00:41:05.313
whether you're a trades

00:41:05.373 --> 00:41:07.474
person with the right attitude or not.

00:41:07.893 --> 00:41:09.253
You just said we're just doing DevOps.

00:41:10.054 --> 00:41:10.333
How?

00:41:11.094 --> 00:41:12.614
Like when you become an electrician,

00:41:13.255 --> 00:41:14.615
there's a lot of stages

00:41:14.635 --> 00:41:15.436
like you got to be like a

00:41:15.516 --> 00:41:16.476
journeyman for like a

00:41:16.596 --> 00:41:18.936
decade before you consider

00:41:18.956 --> 00:41:20.177
like a master electrician

00:41:20.797 --> 00:41:22.117
and every job you do.

00:41:23.117 --> 00:41:24.438
there's a knowledgeable

00:41:24.637 --> 00:41:26.239
inspection that's like,

00:41:26.298 --> 00:41:27.518
this doesn't meet code.

00:41:28.039 --> 00:41:28.780
And you have this,

00:41:29.179 --> 00:41:30.121
sometimes it feels like a

00:41:30.201 --> 00:41:31.420
rigorous feedback loop,

00:41:32.041 --> 00:41:32.981
but there is a feedback

00:41:33.021 --> 00:41:34.463
loop saying that's not quite right.

00:41:35.083 --> 00:41:35.902
And then you have a group of

00:41:35.943 --> 00:41:36.744
people that can look at

00:41:36.784 --> 00:41:38.864
each other's tool bags and like, yo,

00:41:38.905 --> 00:41:40.106
that's what this thing is for.

00:41:40.585 --> 00:41:42.086
This is this particular procedure.

00:41:42.806 --> 00:41:44.347
A lot of times what I've seen, and look,

00:41:44.387 --> 00:41:45.047
it's not everyone.

00:41:45.068 --> 00:41:45.809
There are some people who do

00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:46.909
this immaculately well,

00:41:47.369 --> 00:41:48.769
whether they use the word DevOps or not,

00:41:48.789 --> 00:41:50.070
they're just gonna be good at their jobs.

00:41:50.771 --> 00:41:51.572
But there are some people

00:41:51.612 --> 00:41:53.273
who don't really understand the job,

00:41:53.753 --> 00:41:55.114
but they've adopted the title.

00:41:56.034 --> 00:41:57.556
And so in those scenarios, it's like, oh,

00:41:57.675 --> 00:41:58.016
I mean,

00:41:58.175 --> 00:42:00.458
we just been running this raggedy

00:42:00.498 --> 00:42:02.639
ass script for seven years,

00:42:03.519 --> 00:42:04.860
but it's DevOps now because

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.800
we added flags to it.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.521
It's like, what are you talking about?

00:42:08.382 --> 00:42:09.503
There's this part where you

00:42:09.543 --> 00:42:11.344
have to pay attention to

00:42:11.425 --> 00:42:12.865
how things are changing.

00:42:12.885 --> 00:42:14.086
If you're going to be a

00:42:14.146 --> 00:42:15.146
professional electrician,

00:42:15.288 --> 00:42:16.829
the standards change.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.273
And your job is to have,

00:42:19.554 --> 00:42:21.697
I think they require so

00:42:21.737 --> 00:42:22.978
many hours of continuous

00:42:23.039 --> 00:42:24.880
education to make sure that

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:25.963
you're up to date on the

00:42:26.023 --> 00:42:27.105
various specs and codes.

00:42:27.684 --> 00:42:28.947
I've watched a lot of people

00:42:29.969 --> 00:42:31.329
not learn anything.

00:42:32.172 --> 00:42:32.932
Like even if you're not

00:42:32.952 --> 00:42:33.673
going to use Terraform.

00:42:35.083 --> 00:42:36.382
You should know what it does.

00:42:37.523 --> 00:42:38.384
You should know how it

00:42:38.423 --> 00:42:39.284
compares to the thing

00:42:39.324 --> 00:42:40.264
you're currently doing.

00:42:40.644 --> 00:42:41.264
I'm not saying you got to

00:42:41.344 --> 00:42:43.806
all cargo cult the next new thing,

00:42:44.126 --> 00:42:44.965
but you have to understand

00:42:45.025 --> 00:42:46.347
why the new thing exists.

00:42:46.967 --> 00:42:47.766
You have to at least be able

00:42:47.786 --> 00:42:48.867
to compare to like what

00:42:48.887 --> 00:42:49.748
you're currently doing so

00:42:49.768 --> 00:42:50.788
you can make an informed

00:42:50.807 --> 00:42:52.648
decision not to use it.

00:42:53.108 --> 00:42:54.208
And so I've seen a lot of

00:42:54.248 --> 00:42:55.949
people just holding back themselves.

00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:57.210
their team,

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.172
or the whole organization

00:42:59.213 --> 00:42:59.974
because they forget that

00:43:00.014 --> 00:43:03.057
professional development component that,

00:43:03.398 --> 00:43:03.818
okay,

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.721
are my skills where they need to be?

00:43:06.141 --> 00:43:08.784
Are my tools where they need to be?

00:43:08.804 --> 00:43:09.766
Let's be clear about what I mean,

00:43:10.186 --> 00:43:11.409
are your tools where they need to be?

00:43:13.003 --> 00:43:14.545
Like, those professional IDEs, I'm like,

00:43:14.585 --> 00:43:15.646
why would people ever use those?

00:43:16.726 --> 00:43:17.487
And I remember I was trying

00:43:17.507 --> 00:43:18.849
to get something done in a

00:43:18.869 --> 00:43:19.789
language I'd never used.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:21.610
And I pulled down one of

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:26.014
these JetBrains IDEs, the autocomplete,

00:43:26.954 --> 00:43:27.956
the debugging,

00:43:28.956 --> 00:43:30.237
some of the things they do.

00:43:30.277 --> 00:43:32.659
Because as a full-time software developer,

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.621
I don't have time to be

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.804
switching between seven, five.

00:43:37.844 --> 00:43:39.126
It's going to cost me too much time.

00:43:39.646 --> 00:43:41.146
And you see this with tradespeople.

00:43:41.867 --> 00:43:43.168
Some of the tools they have, like,

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:45.190
why do they make a wrench

00:43:45.251 --> 00:43:46.431
just to do this one thing?

00:43:46.733 --> 00:43:47.472
It's like, because.

00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:49.173
Without this wrench,

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:50.114
you're going to be back and

00:43:50.175 --> 00:43:51.394
forth with the wrong tools.

00:43:51.414 --> 00:43:52.414
You're going to break something.

00:43:52.735 --> 00:43:53.876
You're going to cut yourself.

00:43:54.376 --> 00:43:55.735
That's what this tool is for.

00:43:56.175 --> 00:43:56.815
And so I think as you're

00:43:56.835 --> 00:43:57.577
going to be a person,

00:43:57.717 --> 00:43:59.556
a practitioner in the DevOps movement,

00:43:59.956 --> 00:44:02.257
nothing wrong with being where you are.

00:44:02.938 --> 00:44:04.079
It's just that that can't be

00:44:04.099 --> 00:44:05.639
the case five years from now.

00:44:08.181 --> 00:44:10.021
for sure it's not the type

00:44:10.061 --> 00:44:11.643
of career that you're going

00:44:11.663 --> 00:44:13.563
to land your first job and

00:44:13.583 --> 00:44:14.925
you can ride that thing out

00:44:14.945 --> 00:44:16.144
until you hit sixty five

00:44:16.184 --> 00:44:18.186
and start collecting social

00:44:18.266 --> 00:44:20.047
security well I think the

00:44:20.288 --> 00:44:21.228
mindset is sort of the

00:44:21.268 --> 00:44:22.528
whole point there that the

00:44:22.548 --> 00:44:23.730
mindset is that you have to

00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:24.829
automate your job away

00:44:24.949 --> 00:44:25.610
almost you want to

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:26.570
understand what's an

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:28.512
improvement for that even

00:44:28.552 --> 00:44:29.713
that space you know does

00:44:29.773 --> 00:44:31.954
that mindset translate to

00:44:32.153 --> 00:44:32.954
the team that you're

00:44:32.974 --> 00:44:34.135
working on or the

00:44:34.215 --> 00:44:35.436
organization making the

00:44:35.456 --> 00:44:36.596
shift if that's not what's

00:44:36.635 --> 00:44:37.476
happening you know who is

00:44:37.797 --> 00:44:38.996
Who is responsible for that?

00:44:39.137 --> 00:44:40.016
And, you know, Kelsey,

00:44:40.036 --> 00:44:40.938
you said something here and

00:44:41.338 --> 00:44:42.137
I feel like I got triggered.

00:44:42.157 --> 00:44:43.398
Someone may have heard it and be like, oh,

00:44:43.438 --> 00:44:43.818
you know what?

00:44:43.838 --> 00:44:45.958
There's no like DevOps certification yet,

00:44:46.057 --> 00:44:46.338
right?

00:44:47.079 --> 00:44:48.518
Maybe we should go out and

00:44:48.539 --> 00:44:49.318
get one of those.

00:44:49.559 --> 00:44:50.458
No, you know,

00:44:50.478 --> 00:44:51.338
there's some company that can

00:44:51.378 --> 00:44:53.280
start selling this for sure.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.400
These are the tools you need

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.719
to be having your toolbox

00:44:56.739 --> 00:44:57.860
in order to be an effective

00:44:58.179 --> 00:44:59.141
DevOps person.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.300
You know what?

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:00.860
You know,

00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:02.820
I might say maybe if it was from

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:03.521
a good place,

00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:05.641
if it came from a right kind of moment,

00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:06.581
because, for example,

00:45:06.621 --> 00:45:07.422
you set the mindset.

00:45:08.666 --> 00:45:09.867
it's hard to have a good

00:45:09.947 --> 00:45:10.806
mindset without

00:45:10.827 --> 00:45:12.967
accountability I'm good at

00:45:12.987 --> 00:45:13.967
what I do how do you know

00:45:15.688 --> 00:45:17.230
you don't know right

00:45:17.289 --> 00:45:18.429
because most professional

00:45:18.489 --> 00:45:19.731
endeavors like when I say

00:45:19.811 --> 00:45:20.670
professional meaning

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:23.972
they're judged like yo you are not good

00:45:24.898 --> 00:45:25.577
don't get to play on the

00:45:25.617 --> 00:45:28.079
team you're not good or

00:45:28.619 --> 00:45:30.719
you're good but you're no

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.141
longer competitive see

00:45:33.161 --> 00:45:34.420
that's different like you

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.322
can have ten years of

00:45:35.382 --> 00:45:37.121
experience you've done good

00:45:37.161 --> 00:45:39.742
for us but the new people

00:45:39.762 --> 00:45:42.423
coming into the game the

00:45:42.443 --> 00:45:45.164
game has changed they move

00:45:45.204 --> 00:45:47.085
faster their tools are

00:45:47.166 --> 00:45:48.985
better as much as we want

00:45:49.025 --> 00:45:50.487
to keep you around we cannot

00:45:51.451 --> 00:45:53.913
And so that's when a mindset

00:45:53.932 --> 00:45:54.954
shift has to occur,

00:45:55.514 --> 00:45:56.715
because you just won't have a job.

00:45:57.114 --> 00:45:59.117
But imagine a scenario where

00:45:59.177 --> 00:46:00.478
the company doesn't hire

00:46:00.518 --> 00:46:01.378
those type of people.

00:46:01.599 --> 00:46:02.980
They don't wanna pay for

00:46:03.019 --> 00:46:03.800
those type of people.

00:46:04.141 --> 00:46:05.262
So you're in your little bubble,

00:46:05.902 --> 00:46:07.983
still doing stuff from, like,

00:46:08.063 --> 00:46:09.525
I'm killing it.

00:46:09.545 --> 00:46:11.365
You see this corn shell?

00:46:11.827 --> 00:46:13.007
The spaces are perfect.

00:46:13.427 --> 00:46:14.688
It's like, look,

00:46:14.708 --> 00:46:15.730
nothing wrong with corn shell.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.851
I'm just saying,

00:46:18.391 --> 00:46:20.032
for what you're trying to achieve,

00:46:20.827 --> 00:46:22.268
There might be a better way of doing it.

00:46:22.289 --> 00:46:23.010
He's like, no, it doesn't.

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:24.351
Coursera works just fine.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.650
See,

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.833
that's the dangerous component that I

00:46:26.873 --> 00:46:28.675
think is the trap that a lot of these,

00:46:28.695 --> 00:46:30.476
you know,

00:46:30.496 --> 00:46:31.456
whether it's DevOps or some

00:46:31.496 --> 00:46:34.079
other movement tries to address.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.681
And I do think awareness.

00:46:36.701 --> 00:46:39.163
So I'm not necessarily the biggest fan,

00:46:39.222 --> 00:46:40.344
but it's really valuable

00:46:40.384 --> 00:46:41.965
having things like the DevOps report.

00:46:42.914 --> 00:46:43.936
Because when you get to see

00:46:43.956 --> 00:46:45.338
what other companies are doing,

00:46:46.278 --> 00:46:47.420
that's extremely valuable

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:48.842
because it's hard to get

00:46:48.902 --> 00:46:50.483
better if you don't know

00:46:50.503 --> 00:46:51.224
where the bar is.

00:46:51.865 --> 00:46:52.947
And so I do think people

00:46:52.987 --> 00:46:54.168
have to go and just at

00:46:54.208 --> 00:46:55.010
least do a little bit of

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:57.152
self-reflection and look at

00:46:57.192 --> 00:46:58.534
these things and say, hmm,

00:46:59.375 --> 00:47:01.518
has the goalposts moved and

00:47:01.557 --> 00:47:02.559
should I move towards them?

00:47:05.163 --> 00:47:05.802
Yeah, I mean,

00:47:05.882 --> 00:47:07.923
there's an important aspect here,

00:47:07.943 --> 00:47:09.764
which would be a huge miss otherwise,

00:47:09.885 --> 00:47:10.465
realistically,

00:47:10.505 --> 00:47:13.367
if they're not paying attention to that.

00:47:13.686 --> 00:47:14.987
I think an important aspect

00:47:15.047 --> 00:47:17.429
here is if your company isn't changing,

00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:18.289
it's probably because they

00:47:18.329 --> 00:47:19.369
may not even know, right?

00:47:19.409 --> 00:47:20.871
If you're in the position of doing the...

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:22.789
in what you call DevOps,

00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:24.090
if that's what you're doing,

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:25.050
if that's even your title,

00:47:25.831 --> 00:47:26.411
or maybe you're doing

00:47:26.451 --> 00:47:27.552
something that helps and

00:47:27.572 --> 00:47:29.052
just supports the teams by

00:47:29.092 --> 00:47:29.911
building some tools,

00:47:31.172 --> 00:47:32.512
you're not innovating in that space.

00:47:32.552 --> 00:47:33.393
If you're not going out and

00:47:33.452 --> 00:47:34.753
learning those additional

00:47:35.793 --> 00:47:36.554
what other companies are

00:47:36.574 --> 00:47:38.514
doing or what new tools are available,

00:47:39.094 --> 00:47:40.394
even how the mindset is changing,

00:47:40.635 --> 00:47:41.355
there may not be anyone

00:47:41.394 --> 00:47:42.614
doing that else in the company.

00:47:43.635 --> 00:47:44.356
That means your company

00:47:44.396 --> 00:47:45.016
won't be effective.

00:47:45.036 --> 00:47:45.695
Your company won't be

00:47:45.735 --> 00:47:46.936
innovating if you're not

00:47:46.956 --> 00:47:47.677
the one doing that.

00:47:47.757 --> 00:47:48.436
And I feel like

00:47:49.157 --> 00:47:50.018
If you're just focusing on

00:47:50.059 --> 00:47:51.619
the tools you've got and

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.141
what has been working for

00:47:53.161 --> 00:47:54.724
the last ten to twenty years,

00:47:56.045 --> 00:47:57.447
you're definitely going to

00:47:57.507 --> 00:47:58.148
be falling behind.

00:47:59.248 --> 00:48:00.411
Now, one thing I will say, though,

00:48:00.731 --> 00:48:01.271
there are some things I

00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:02.112
don't want to change.

00:48:03.637 --> 00:48:04.559
And so I know we say

00:48:04.599 --> 00:48:06.639
innovation a lot and

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.021
someone should be innovating for sure.

00:48:09.282 --> 00:48:10.583
Somewhere there should

00:48:10.682 --> 00:48:11.822
always be some form of

00:48:11.862 --> 00:48:12.844
innovation happening.

00:48:13.403 --> 00:48:14.804
It's harder than most people think.

00:48:15.606 --> 00:48:16.606
And sometimes you do just

00:48:16.626 --> 00:48:18.648
need companies to be in execution mode.

00:48:19.898 --> 00:48:22.260
Like some of these microphones,

00:48:22.742 --> 00:48:23.983
like this R-A-Twenty that

00:48:24.003 --> 00:48:25.184
I'm using from Electro-Voice,

00:48:26.005 --> 00:48:26.847
these things are roughly

00:48:26.887 --> 00:48:28.929
the same for decades.

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:30.731
And when you change them,

00:48:31.291 --> 00:48:32.432
because you're trying to do innovation,

00:48:32.472 --> 00:48:34.715
like add a USB-C port on it,

00:48:35.697 --> 00:48:37.219
and it throws off the sound

00:48:37.679 --> 00:48:39.262
because of the circuitry that you put in.

00:48:40.134 --> 00:48:41.233
Don't want that innovation.

00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:44.514
Leave the XLR cable and I

00:48:44.534 --> 00:48:46.956
will plug it into my own end.

00:48:46.976 --> 00:48:47.815
Don't change it.

00:48:48.295 --> 00:48:48.436
Now,

00:48:48.755 --> 00:48:50.617
they've innovated to get to this point,

00:48:51.117 --> 00:48:51.657
no doubt.

00:48:52.336 --> 00:48:54.757
But sometimes people say, hey,

00:48:54.938 --> 00:48:57.237
so it's such a hard thing to do.

00:48:57.257 --> 00:48:57.498
It's like,

00:48:57.639 --> 00:49:01.679
when do you change and when do you not?

00:49:02.519 --> 00:49:03.760
And I think that's the part

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.079
where a skillful person

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:06.740
will constantly be aware

00:49:07.501 --> 00:49:08.740
and have a good reason,

00:49:09.521 --> 00:49:11.541
we do not need to use this

00:49:11.621 --> 00:49:13.202
new thing in this context.

00:49:13.663 --> 00:49:14.903
So I just want you to be aware,

00:49:15.643 --> 00:49:16.824
have the ability to,

00:49:17.364 --> 00:49:19.724
but boy is judgment so

00:49:19.784 --> 00:49:21.385
important to keep you from

00:49:21.465 --> 00:49:22.686
chasing new and shiny

00:49:23.326 --> 00:49:24.347
versus staying focused on

00:49:24.367 --> 00:49:25.146
the task at hand.

00:49:25.711 --> 00:49:27.871
I use a personal rule here.

00:49:28.273 --> 00:49:30.112
It's my rule of three,

00:49:30.152 --> 00:49:30.972
Warren's rule of three.

00:49:31.012 --> 00:49:32.693
If I hear about a product or

00:49:32.713 --> 00:49:34.713
a tool or an area, mindset,

00:49:34.753 --> 00:49:36.414
whatever it is, three times,

00:49:36.873 --> 00:49:38.034
I know that I have to

00:49:38.074 --> 00:49:39.135
invest in understanding

00:49:39.414 --> 00:49:40.454
what that is more.

00:49:40.934 --> 00:49:42.494
Either because if I don't,

00:49:42.554 --> 00:49:43.376
no one else will do it.

00:49:43.856 --> 00:49:45.795
Maybe it really will become my problem.

00:49:46.655 --> 00:49:48.137
It will land on my lap in some way,

00:49:48.217 --> 00:49:49.117
and I'll regret not having

00:49:49.137 --> 00:49:49.757
done it earlier.

00:49:50.277 --> 00:49:51.797
Or I may just be the only

00:49:51.858 --> 00:49:53.179
person who is at the

00:49:53.199 --> 00:49:54.298
intersection of where that

00:49:54.318 --> 00:49:54.980
keeps happening.

00:49:55.119 --> 00:49:56.440
I'm the right person to

00:49:56.541 --> 00:50:01.824
actually take that next step.

00:50:01.864 --> 00:50:03.445
So if I say Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,

00:50:03.465 --> 00:50:05.806
Beetlejuice, that's three, right?

00:50:05.826 --> 00:50:06.786
There's a second movie coming out.

00:50:09.652 --> 00:50:10.012
There is,

00:50:10.032 --> 00:50:11.673
and I cannot tell you how excited

00:50:11.713 --> 00:50:12.753
my wife is to see it.

00:50:12.773 --> 00:50:14.815
It's like, oh,

00:50:14.835 --> 00:50:16.556
I didn't know this was a thing, but okay,

00:50:17.155 --> 00:50:17.775
let's go.

00:50:18.036 --> 00:50:19.177
Vita Juice is a classic.

00:50:19.277 --> 00:50:21.376
I mean, I went back and watched it.

00:50:21.416 --> 00:50:23.518
I was like, yo, I mean,

00:50:23.938 --> 00:50:25.378
you got to be into that kind of thing,

00:50:25.418 --> 00:50:28.420
but it is a classic for its time,

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.860
and even the rewatchability

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:30.601
was pretty good.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.081
So the rewatchability was good on it?

00:50:34.186 --> 00:50:35.327
I mean, part one, I mean,

00:50:35.389 --> 00:50:36.550
it's a quirky movie.

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:38.833
Some things I thought were amazing.

00:50:38.893 --> 00:50:39.974
I go back and watch it like, yo,

00:50:40.014 --> 00:50:41.275
this is pretty terrible.

00:50:42.197 --> 00:50:44.099
But Peterjuice has its own

00:50:44.219 --> 00:50:46.041
unique style and story

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.682
format and visuals.

00:50:48.224 --> 00:50:49.344
I think it's worth a rewatch.

00:50:50.016 --> 00:50:50.597
Right on.

00:50:50.637 --> 00:50:51.597
Cause I remember seeing it

00:50:51.637 --> 00:50:53.000
whenever I was younger, but,

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.400
but like you said, so many,

00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:56.322
like there's so many movies

00:50:56.623 --> 00:50:57.403
I watched when I was

00:50:57.443 --> 00:50:58.804
younger that I just have

00:50:58.885 --> 00:51:00.025
built up in my mind.

00:51:00.186 --> 00:51:01.606
And then I go back and rewatch them.

00:51:01.646 --> 00:51:02.608
I was like, Oh, that was,

00:51:03.329 --> 00:51:03.969
I should have just stuck

00:51:03.989 --> 00:51:04.989
with the memory on that one.

00:51:09.715 --> 00:51:11.817
I'm lucky if I remember the titles,

00:51:11.916 --> 00:51:13.416
because I saw so many

00:51:13.456 --> 00:51:14.918
movies where you missed the

00:51:14.958 --> 00:51:16.018
first couple of minutes.

00:51:16.619 --> 00:51:17.719
And this is back, of course,

00:51:17.778 --> 00:51:20.239
where if you don't see the title screen,

00:51:20.599 --> 00:51:21.079
that's it.

00:51:21.181 --> 00:51:21.481
You know,

00:51:21.521 --> 00:51:22.621
you'll never know what the name

00:51:22.641 --> 00:51:24.762
of that movie is ever again.

00:51:25.641 --> 00:51:27.322
If I'm lucky, like years down the road,

00:51:27.422 --> 00:51:29.164
I'd see a rerun of it.

00:51:29.563 --> 00:51:30.463
And I'll watch the beginning,

00:51:30.903 --> 00:51:33.445
see the name of the title, and then, wait,

00:51:33.505 --> 00:51:34.465
I've seen this before,

00:51:34.565 --> 00:51:35.945
but I have no idea what it is.

00:51:36.527 --> 00:51:37.586
And then I'd put it together.

00:51:40.548 --> 00:51:41.630
to get entertained twice.

00:51:42.971 --> 00:51:43.130
I mean,

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:44.192
there's movies I probably watched

00:51:44.251 --> 00:51:45.652
ten times and still don't

00:51:45.693 --> 00:51:46.454
get the title right.

00:51:46.574 --> 00:51:51.217
I think it's The Last Dragon.

00:51:51.318 --> 00:51:53.360
Yeah, The Last Dragon, I believe.

00:51:54.019 --> 00:51:55.141
And I don't know the title,

00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:57.802
but it's like a spoof on karate movies,

00:51:57.822 --> 00:51:58.824
but it's a serious movie.

00:51:58.864 --> 00:51:59.744
Bruce Leroy,

00:52:00.565 --> 00:52:02.266
they got this glow thing going

00:52:02.746 --> 00:52:04.068
and it's like in like the

00:52:04.248 --> 00:52:05.969
eighties settings and you

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:07.371
got black folks doing kung

00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:09.492
fu and karate in Harlem.

00:52:10.179 --> 00:52:12.481
It is insane, this movie.

00:52:12.641 --> 00:52:14.224
If you haven't seen The Last Dragon,

00:52:15.945 --> 00:52:16.706
you don't know whether to

00:52:16.766 --> 00:52:17.967
laugh or take it serious

00:52:18.027 --> 00:52:19.528
because it's just that type of movie.

00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:21.630
So if you've ever seen Big Trouble,

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:22.291
Little China,

00:52:22.711 --> 00:52:25.673
it's in the same realm of those.

00:52:25.693 --> 00:52:26.594
So if you've seen Big Trouble,

00:52:26.614 --> 00:52:27.195
Little China,

00:52:27.775 --> 00:52:28.697
then you have to add The

00:52:28.717 --> 00:52:30.038
Last Dragon to the

00:52:30.077 --> 00:52:32.179
collection just to round things out.

00:52:35.518 --> 00:52:36.579
I'm making a note of that.

00:52:36.739 --> 00:52:36.880
I am.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:37.661
There's got to be a black

00:52:37.681 --> 00:52:38.961
guy doing this thing.

00:52:39.061 --> 00:52:40.443
If you see that, Bruce Leroy.

00:52:40.963 --> 00:52:41.824
That's how you know.

00:52:41.884 --> 00:52:44.246
I'm not talking to one with Bruce Lee.

00:52:44.806 --> 00:52:47.668
No, this is Bruce Leroy.

00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:48.349
Seriously.

00:52:48.849 --> 00:52:49.630
And you watch it.

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:51.331
There's the bad guy is Shogun.

00:52:51.411 --> 00:52:52.693
Like, trust me,

00:52:53.454 --> 00:52:54.655
I think you're going to appreciate it.

00:52:56.235 --> 00:52:57.317
I know what I'm doing tonight.

00:53:02.081 --> 00:53:02.860
So do you spend a lot of

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:03.621
time watching movies?

00:53:05.911 --> 00:53:07.371
I know, but when I do,

00:53:07.831 --> 00:53:12.014
I try to really lean into that one movie.

00:53:12.114 --> 00:53:13.273
I try not to judge whether

00:53:13.313 --> 00:53:14.894
this movie is better than that movie.

00:53:15.594 --> 00:53:16.576
You're going to watch a

00:53:16.635 --> 00:53:17.655
movie that's like two and a

00:53:17.675 --> 00:53:18.637
half hours of your life.

00:53:19.717 --> 00:53:21.438
I just try to just really

00:53:21.478 --> 00:53:23.018
appreciate that movie.

00:53:23.097 --> 00:53:25.059
And I used to have this,

00:53:25.079 --> 00:53:26.260
I don't think it was a good rule at all.

00:53:27.463 --> 00:53:28.902
If I've seen it already, I'm done.

00:53:28.983 --> 00:53:29.824
I don't want to see it again.

00:53:29.844 --> 00:53:31.264
I already saw it.

00:53:31.844 --> 00:53:32.884
But now what I'm realizing

00:53:32.903 --> 00:53:34.965
is that second and third watch,

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.565
you're starting to notice

00:53:36.585 --> 00:53:37.686
and pick up on things.

00:53:37.726 --> 00:53:38.646
Like now that you got the

00:53:38.686 --> 00:53:39.905
plot and you go back and

00:53:39.925 --> 00:53:41.527
you just watch how they build up to it,

00:53:42.246 --> 00:53:43.746
sometimes you can respect it more.

00:53:44.648 --> 00:53:45.788
Sometimes instead of you,

00:53:45.807 --> 00:53:46.387
because I used to get

00:53:46.447 --> 00:53:47.768
nervous when you're watching a movie,

00:53:47.788 --> 00:53:48.929
I don't want to pay

00:53:48.969 --> 00:53:50.068
attention too much to this

00:53:50.168 --> 00:53:50.969
one character because they

00:53:51.009 --> 00:53:52.929
may not be around the whole movie.

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:53.469
Right.

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:55.349
But once you go through it once,

00:53:55.409 --> 00:53:56.510
then you can go back to the

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:57.650
character development.

00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.771
Why do they make these

00:53:58.831 --> 00:54:01.032
flawed decisions or good decisions?

00:54:01.452 --> 00:54:02.952
So yeah, multiple times,

00:54:03.032 --> 00:54:05.333
but I'm a little bit more patient now.

00:54:05.472 --> 00:54:06.733
I for sure had the same

00:54:06.793 --> 00:54:08.853
problem very early on.

00:54:09.032 --> 00:54:09.414
I was like,

00:54:09.514 --> 00:54:10.833
I don't need to watch anything again.

00:54:11.094 --> 00:54:12.353
It's already ruined if

00:54:12.373 --> 00:54:13.695
there's a spoiler or a twist.

00:54:13.735 --> 00:54:16.114
And I was particularly a fan of film noir,

00:54:16.195 --> 00:54:17.054
but I think what broke me

00:54:17.094 --> 00:54:18.695
was actually re-watching Futurama,

00:54:19.215 --> 00:54:19.476
where...

00:54:20.596 --> 00:54:21.617
Such a high level of

00:54:21.677 --> 00:54:23.038
intellect gone into

00:54:23.117 --> 00:54:24.039
building every single

00:54:24.139 --> 00:54:26.041
episode and the story is so

00:54:26.081 --> 00:54:27.222
continuous over the

00:54:27.561 --> 00:54:28.882
original seven season run

00:54:29.382 --> 00:54:31.144
that there are some little

00:54:31.184 --> 00:54:32.945
jokes that you don't get.

00:54:33.045 --> 00:54:34.327
You for sure will never get.

00:54:35.902 --> 00:54:36.722
that you only know because

00:54:36.742 --> 00:54:37.663
you know the later content.

00:54:37.682 --> 00:54:38.983
And you come back and

00:54:39.003 --> 00:54:40.304
there's an episode where someone says,

00:54:40.704 --> 00:54:41.664
oh yeah, that's ridiculous,

00:54:41.684 --> 00:54:42.585
that could never happen.

00:54:42.646 --> 00:54:43.465
But you don't know why

00:54:43.485 --> 00:54:45.387
that's the case until later.

00:54:45.867 --> 00:54:47.688
And I feel like you get

00:54:47.768 --> 00:54:49.210
double entertainment out of

00:54:49.269 --> 00:54:51.110
some of your favorite movies for sure.

00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:52.192
But you know what's odd though?

00:54:53.311 --> 00:54:54.992
We don't typically do that with music.

00:54:55.914 --> 00:54:57.016
We can listen to the same

00:54:57.056 --> 00:54:59.518
song over and over and over again,

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.842
but movies, for some reason, we feel like,

00:55:02.083 --> 00:55:02.382
you know,

00:55:02.402 --> 00:55:04.365
maybe if the plot is ruined or

00:55:04.385 --> 00:55:05.586
we know how it's going to end,

00:55:06.088 --> 00:55:07.188
but we know how songs end.

00:55:08.023 --> 00:55:09.304
and we still listen to them again.

00:55:09.885 --> 00:55:10.746
And the one thing I'd done

00:55:10.827 --> 00:55:12.007
on the music side was

00:55:12.568 --> 00:55:13.869
listen to it sometimes with

00:55:13.889 --> 00:55:14.690
the lyrics up.

00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:15.990
Like on Apple Music,

00:55:16.331 --> 00:55:17.693
you can bring up the lyrics.

00:55:17.932 --> 00:55:19.034
And so as you're listening,

00:55:19.454 --> 00:55:21.096
you can also read the words.

00:55:21.356 --> 00:55:22.135
And sometimes I would just

00:55:22.157 --> 00:55:23.077
go read the words without

00:55:23.117 --> 00:55:25.418
listening to the song because number one,

00:55:25.579 --> 00:55:26.679
I'm not, I can't sing.

00:55:27.778 --> 00:55:28.639
And it turns out I don't

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.300
know the lyrics to the

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.023
majority of the songs I listened to.

00:55:32.543 --> 00:55:33.003
And people are like,

00:55:33.043 --> 00:55:34.224
you know what that song is about, right?

00:55:34.244 --> 00:55:35.085
I'm like, no,

00:55:35.485 --> 00:55:36.806
I don't know what that song is about.

00:55:37.447 --> 00:55:38.768
And so now I found it really

00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:39.809
important to understand

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:42.052
what the artist was thinking at the time.

00:55:43.242 --> 00:55:45.485
the artist is and why they

00:55:45.525 --> 00:55:46.465
write the song the way that

00:55:46.505 --> 00:55:47.847
they wrote it because it's

00:55:47.947 --> 00:55:49.347
so important it brings so

00:55:49.369 --> 00:55:51.150
much depth to music like in

00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:52.110
the air of the night phil

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:54.452
collins like that song is

00:55:54.512 --> 00:55:55.474
super deep most people

00:55:55.614 --> 00:55:56.295
don't really understand

00:55:56.315 --> 00:55:57.215
what it's about but when

00:55:57.255 --> 00:55:59.016
you read the lyrics and

00:55:59.056 --> 00:56:00.077
then your mind starts to

00:56:00.137 --> 00:56:01.858
like fill in the gaps you're like oh

00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:03.755
This is a very serious song.

00:56:03.775 --> 00:56:04.335
And then you learn the

00:56:04.375 --> 00:56:05.434
context of the song of

00:56:05.534 --> 00:56:06.436
inviting the person to the

00:56:06.456 --> 00:56:09.757
concert and then singing the song.

00:56:09.958 --> 00:56:10.978
It's like, this is much deeper.

00:56:11.018 --> 00:56:12.679
So then it finds its place

00:56:12.998 --> 00:56:14.900
in kind of my top songs of all time.

00:56:16.063 --> 00:56:17.864
I see that there's a huge

00:56:17.905 --> 00:56:18.985
pattern with how you

00:56:19.025 --> 00:56:21.266
approach just whatever you're focusing on,

00:56:21.306 --> 00:56:23.507
whether or not it's music, movies,

00:56:23.949 --> 00:56:25.648
personal life, or professionally.

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:27.610
This idea to really have the

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:29.411
discipline to go really

00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:30.612
deep in whatever that thing

00:56:30.672 --> 00:56:31.632
is that you're working on.

00:56:31.952 --> 00:56:33.373
There's not just one more

00:56:33.414 --> 00:56:34.474
thing or whatever I'm doing

00:56:34.514 --> 00:56:35.335
at this moment, but

00:56:35.695 --> 00:56:37.135
real, a hundred percent focus,

00:56:37.175 --> 00:56:39.356
probably more on that area

00:56:39.396 --> 00:56:40.376
so that you can fully

00:56:40.476 --> 00:56:42.336
understand and appreciate, uh,

00:56:42.376 --> 00:56:42.896
whatever that is.

00:56:42.916 --> 00:56:43.418
And I, like,

00:56:43.737 --> 00:56:44.818
I feel like there's a lot of

00:56:45.077 --> 00:56:46.157
aspect where I do that,

00:56:46.197 --> 00:56:47.539
but it really does require

00:56:47.639 --> 00:56:50.219
intentional discipline to pull that off.

00:56:50.239 --> 00:56:50.920
It's not something that

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.420
happens accidentally.

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.760
I mean, I think I'm,

00:56:55.141 --> 00:56:56.842
I'm afraid of things I don't understand.

00:56:58.344 --> 00:56:58.844
You know what I mean?

00:56:58.885 --> 00:56:59.045
Like,

00:56:59.204 --> 00:57:00.804
what does this thing do and why is it

00:57:00.844 --> 00:57:01.346
doing it?

00:57:02.346 --> 00:57:04.045
And so whenever that question comes up,

00:57:04.346 --> 00:57:06.806
I feel like I gotta solve it.

00:57:07.586 --> 00:57:08.467
You know, it's like when people,

00:57:08.626 --> 00:57:09.266
like I'm one of these

00:57:09.306 --> 00:57:10.586
people that if I see a puzzle,

00:57:11.467 --> 00:57:12.166
it's over for me.

00:57:12.887 --> 00:57:14.007
And my mom knows this,

00:57:14.047 --> 00:57:15.527
like I'm forty-three years old.

00:57:15.608 --> 00:57:16.407
When I go visit,

00:57:17.228 --> 00:57:20.489
she has a new puzzle on the table.

00:57:21.708 --> 00:57:24.510
And she opens the box, puts it next to it,

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:26.449
and there'd be the pieces scattered out.

00:57:26.489 --> 00:57:27.170
And I'm like, oh my God.

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:29.489
puzzle.

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:30.490
This must be solved.

00:57:31.351 --> 00:57:32.851
Now.

00:57:32.871 --> 00:57:33.652
You're on the way out.

00:57:35.632 --> 00:57:36.512
I gotta do at least a few

00:57:36.552 --> 00:57:37.693
pieces before we leave.

00:57:37.773 --> 00:57:39.034
And before the trip is over,

00:57:39.693 --> 00:57:42.235
I am not satisfied until

00:57:42.255 --> 00:57:43.295
that puzzle is solved.

00:57:44.195 --> 00:57:46.096
And so my real life is like this too.

00:57:46.155 --> 00:57:48.277
It's like, why did someone do this?

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:51.552
why is the stock its current

00:57:51.592 --> 00:57:54.215
price does my phone listen

00:57:54.255 --> 00:57:56.777
to me if so how like I just

00:57:56.858 --> 00:57:58.019
need to know these things

00:57:58.059 --> 00:57:59.400
so I it also keeps me from

00:58:00.601 --> 00:58:01.362
I think a lot of stress

00:58:01.382 --> 00:58:02.764
people have you're trying

00:58:02.784 --> 00:58:03.485
to pay attention to

00:58:03.664 --> 00:58:05.766
everything and then you

00:58:05.786 --> 00:58:06.768
don't know how anything

00:58:06.847 --> 00:58:08.869
works and so then you're

00:58:08.889 --> 00:58:09.650
just you're not really

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:11.353
growing or improving and

00:58:11.393 --> 00:58:13.094
these people are very susceptible to

00:58:14.661 --> 00:58:16.204
chatter, propaganda.

00:58:16.945 --> 00:58:18.047
They don't know what's true

00:58:18.068 --> 00:58:19.050
or what's not because they

00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:20.271
don't have time to process.

00:58:20.793 --> 00:58:23.257
So everything is just streamed at them.

00:58:24.284 --> 00:58:26.485
And then everything just happens to them.

00:58:27.387 --> 00:58:28.427
And so I think it's like

00:58:28.847 --> 00:58:29.568
when you first get into

00:58:29.688 --> 00:58:31.851
tech and you log into your first server,

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:34.172
SSH XYZ, and you're in.

00:58:34.753 --> 00:58:37.376
And you're like, oh.

00:58:37.456 --> 00:58:38.456
And so you can actually go

00:58:38.496 --> 00:58:39.378
really far in your career

00:58:39.398 --> 00:58:42.260
just running commands over and over.

00:58:42.619 --> 00:58:43.280
And it doesn't work.

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.561
You ask someone, what do I do here?

00:58:44.581 --> 00:58:45.483
They say, run it this way.

00:58:45.543 --> 00:58:46.364
And you just run it this way.

00:58:46.403 --> 00:58:47.264
You're an operator.

00:58:48.083 --> 00:58:49.947
But the moment you write

00:58:49.967 --> 00:58:52.032
that first shell script and

00:58:52.052 --> 00:58:52.873
you make the other scripts

00:58:52.934 --> 00:58:53.916
do something different,

00:58:55.014 --> 00:58:56.594
That's when you feel like, hey,

00:58:57.074 --> 00:58:58.135
I'm not just here to be a

00:58:58.175 --> 00:59:00.217
consumer or an operator,

00:59:00.797 --> 00:59:01.958
I can create stuff too.

00:59:02.737 --> 00:59:04.099
But the key though is you

00:59:04.119 --> 00:59:04.820
have to know how things

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:06.900
actually work and then you

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.422
can rearrange the pieces.

00:59:09.001 --> 00:59:10.762
And so when it comes to anything in life,

00:59:10.782 --> 00:59:11.342
it's like, hey,

00:59:11.664 --> 00:59:13.123
you can't learn everything, Kelsey,

00:59:13.164 --> 00:59:13.905
like you're right.

00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:14.945
I'm just saying,

00:59:15.025 --> 00:59:15.806
learn the things you're

00:59:15.865 --> 00:59:17.726
dealing with in that moment.

00:59:18.086 --> 00:59:19.407
So if you're gonna be listening to a song,

00:59:19.748 --> 00:59:20.548
just read the lyrics.

00:59:21.108 --> 00:59:21.929
Who was the artist?

00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:23.489
Were they in a band previously?

00:59:24.269 --> 00:59:25.510
What other music did they do?

00:59:25.771 --> 00:59:26.891
What genre is this?

00:59:27.472 --> 00:59:28.572
Do you like that genre?

00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:29.873
Who else is in this genre?

00:59:30.273 --> 00:59:31.213
So then that just gives you

00:59:31.253 --> 00:59:32.893
a chance to go super deep

00:59:33.655 --> 00:59:34.994
on this thing that's in front of you.

00:59:35.414 --> 00:59:37.056
And then hopefully by the

00:59:37.096 --> 00:59:38.456
time you're also forty three,

00:59:38.876 --> 00:59:39.956
you've done this so many

00:59:40.016 --> 00:59:42.077
times that it does feel

00:59:42.097 --> 00:59:42.878
like you're a knowledgeable

00:59:42.938 --> 00:59:44.338
person because you've taken

00:59:44.358 --> 00:59:45.639
the time to go deep

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:47.320
What do we call these people?

00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.081
We call them like T-shaped engineers.

00:59:49.481 --> 00:59:51.322
They have the breath, but the depth.

00:59:51.902 --> 00:59:53.342
Because instead of just like

00:59:53.382 --> 00:59:54.262
learning a bunch of things,

00:59:54.302 --> 00:59:55.063
they went deep.

00:59:55.463 --> 00:59:56.943
And so, yeah, it does take a long time.

00:59:56.983 --> 00:59:58.844
But when you're done, you have both.

01:00:02.626 --> 01:00:03.065
I really like it.

01:00:03.085 --> 01:00:04.146
So do you have a favorite?

01:00:04.206 --> 01:00:06.007
Sorry.

01:00:06.047 --> 01:00:07.286
Do you have a favorite genre of music?

01:00:10.748 --> 01:00:11.728
I grew up on hip hop.

01:00:13.148 --> 01:00:14.409
And the reason why that's so

01:00:14.469 --> 01:00:15.570
nostalgic as a kid

01:00:17.059 --> 01:00:18.581
good things would happen in your life,

01:00:19.585 --> 01:00:19.824
right?

01:00:19.885 --> 01:00:21.168
Like you would go outside,

01:00:21.188 --> 01:00:22.309
you would win the game.

01:00:23.012 --> 01:00:24.114
You just got a new Nintendo

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:25.257
game for your birthday.

01:00:25.717 --> 01:00:27.320
So you remember the song that was playing.

01:00:28.373 --> 01:00:29.675
Like you're listening to your,

01:00:30.056 --> 01:00:31.237
back in my day, Walkman.

01:00:31.277 --> 01:00:33.358
And you played this game,

01:00:33.378 --> 01:00:33.958
you had a really good

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:34.900
experience playing the game,

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.380
and this is a song you heard first.

01:00:36.802 --> 01:00:38.802
And that song etches the

01:00:38.862 --> 01:00:41.385
memory and links everything together.

01:00:41.846 --> 01:00:43.447
And so for me, that was hip-hop.

01:00:44.088 --> 01:00:45.168
And then when I was reading

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:46.750
the lyrics around hip-hop

01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:48.311
and studying the origins of hip-hop,

01:00:49.505 --> 01:00:50.385
you think about this group

01:00:50.405 --> 01:00:52.085
of people in the earliest

01:00:52.425 --> 01:00:53.846
forms of that genre,

01:00:54.686 --> 01:00:55.686
you can't afford

01:00:56.806 --> 01:00:59.407
instruments and creating

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:00.447
music from scratch.

01:01:00.967 --> 01:01:01.827
A lot of people didn't go to

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:04.489
school for music theory and

01:01:04.528 --> 01:01:06.469
knew how to read or write sheet music.

01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:09.030
But what you did know is

01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:11.010
like what music you like

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:12.550
and what music other people like.

01:01:12.949 --> 01:01:13.550
And so what do you do?

01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:14.590
You take records,

01:01:15.637 --> 01:01:17.780
And you find the part that everyone likes.

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:18.961
How do you know it's a good part?

01:01:19.543 --> 01:01:21.085
Because you're watching people dance.

01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:22.927
And when it gets to that break,

01:01:22.967 --> 01:01:23.688
you're like, oh,

01:01:23.748 --> 01:01:25.429
people seem to like this part.

01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:28.614
So you take that part and you loop it.

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:31.195
not with some fancy computer or screen.

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:32.235
You literally got two

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:33.195
turntables and you're

01:01:33.295 --> 01:01:35.036
marking on the record where

01:01:35.077 --> 01:01:38.038
the good part is and you loop it, right?

01:01:38.077 --> 01:01:39.559
And then the next person is like, yo,

01:01:40.139 --> 01:01:42.840
I can rhyme over the top of the good part,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.880
but you just got to keep it

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.081
going long enough for me to do this.

01:01:47.021 --> 01:01:48.961
And so you just think about how technical

01:01:49.793 --> 01:01:52.695
you need to be to produce hip hop.

01:01:52.936 --> 01:01:54.378
You can't play any instruments.

01:01:54.958 --> 01:01:56.619
You can't necessarily resheet music.

01:01:56.681 --> 01:01:57.902
I'm not saying everyone's like that.

01:01:57.922 --> 01:01:58.702
There's so many people in

01:01:58.722 --> 01:02:00.385
this genre then and now.

01:02:01.005 --> 01:02:02.065
But to still be able to

01:02:02.126 --> 01:02:03.467
create something that has

01:02:03.507 --> 01:02:04.728
such a global impact

01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:06.150
And also,

01:02:06.411 --> 01:02:07.733
when you look at the history of a

01:02:07.773 --> 01:02:08.673
lot of those people,

01:02:09.153 --> 01:02:10.076
they're coming from some

01:02:10.135 --> 01:02:11.737
really rough environments

01:02:12.358 --> 01:02:14.139
where there's a lot of politics,

01:02:14.219 --> 01:02:15.461
things that are happening to them,

01:02:15.521 --> 01:02:16.503
various movements.

01:02:17.244 --> 01:02:19.447
And for anyone that writes blog posts,

01:02:19.706 --> 01:02:22.690
journals, anything, writing is thinking.

01:02:23.481 --> 01:02:24.382
And a lot of those people,

01:02:24.402 --> 01:02:25.603
when they wrote their rhymes,

01:02:26.163 --> 01:02:27.222
they were showing you or

01:02:27.282 --> 01:02:29.322
expressing their situation.

01:02:29.764 --> 01:02:31.083
They couldn't get media coverage.

01:02:31.463 --> 01:02:32.443
They're not on the movies.

01:02:32.463 --> 01:02:33.804
They're not on the TV shows,

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:35.264
but they got their music.

01:02:35.905 --> 01:02:37.164
And so hip hop to me is one

01:02:37.184 --> 01:02:39.326
of those things where it

01:02:39.365 --> 01:02:40.565
documented my life.

01:02:41.025 --> 01:02:41.907
You're hearing other people

01:02:41.987 --> 01:02:42.927
document theirs.

01:02:43.626 --> 01:02:44.327
And it's just one of these

01:02:44.367 --> 01:02:45.527
genres that resonates so much,

01:02:45.606 --> 01:02:47.588
but then the bleed in and crossover,

01:02:47.947 --> 01:02:48.688
because when I go listen to

01:02:48.748 --> 01:02:51.268
other genres of music, the drum patterns,

01:02:52.025 --> 01:02:55.146
the rhyme schemes, the collaborations,

01:02:55.206 --> 01:02:55.407
right?

01:02:55.447 --> 01:02:57.108
So the first time I remember

01:02:57.128 --> 01:02:58.889
listening to like other genres of music,

01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:00.590
when I heard like a rap

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.231
artist and an R&B artist

01:03:02.271 --> 01:03:04.713
get on a record together, I'm like,

01:03:04.753 --> 01:03:05.273
what's that?

01:03:05.954 --> 01:03:06.795
When I started to understand

01:03:06.815 --> 01:03:09.275
where the samples came from, oh,

01:03:09.637 --> 01:03:10.958
what is this disco thing?

01:03:11.856 --> 01:03:13.336
What is this jazz thing?

01:03:13.797 --> 01:03:14.757
And so then it just kind of

01:03:14.818 --> 01:03:16.498
branched out into these other genres.

01:03:16.518 --> 01:03:17.918
So that's the nucleus for me,

01:03:18.438 --> 01:03:19.418
but it branched me into all

01:03:19.458 --> 01:03:20.079
these other ones.

01:03:20.119 --> 01:03:21.199
So I love Sade.

01:03:21.878 --> 01:03:23.000
Sometimes I just need to be

01:03:23.039 --> 01:03:24.119
calm and relaxed.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.519
So I'll jump into Sade.

01:03:26.521 --> 01:03:28.101
I grew up in Southern California.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.280
And I remember hearing Nirvana,

01:03:30.501 --> 01:03:32.041
Teen Spirit for the first time, right?

01:03:32.061 --> 01:03:33.041
I'm all in my hip hop.

01:03:33.561 --> 01:03:34.601
But when you hear that song,

01:03:34.661 --> 01:03:35.742
I don't care what genre of

01:03:35.802 --> 01:03:36.443
music you like.

01:03:36.983 --> 01:03:39.304
That one's going to jump in.

01:03:39.764 --> 01:03:40.726
And then last thing I would

01:03:40.746 --> 01:03:42.407
say is when I play Guitar Hero,

01:03:43.347 --> 01:03:44.829
I was never into some of

01:03:44.849 --> 01:03:46.250
the rock and metal stuff.

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:47.632
I never branched out.

01:03:48.351 --> 01:03:50.193
But man, playing Guitar Hero,

01:03:50.253 --> 01:03:51.514
and you get introduced to

01:03:51.635 --> 01:03:52.876
all of these bands,

01:03:53.476 --> 01:03:54.556
and there's something about

01:03:55.557 --> 01:03:56.958
paying attention to a song.

01:03:57.498 --> 01:03:58.981
I've listened to rock in the past,

01:03:59.661 --> 01:04:01.322
but it didn't jive.

01:04:01.382 --> 01:04:02.443
It just didn't make sense.

01:04:02.503 --> 01:04:03.884
But then when you play Guitar Hero,

01:04:04.701 --> 01:04:06.121
You're not reading sheet music,

01:04:06.161 --> 01:04:07.282
but you gotta pay attention

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:09.704
to the song so you can play the notes."

01:04:10.344 --> 01:04:13.626
And at that moment, I was like,

01:04:13.786 --> 01:04:15.248
I can't even push the color

01:04:15.288 --> 01:04:16.168
buttons fast enough.

01:04:16.588 --> 01:04:18.369
How is Slash doing this in real life?

01:04:19.804 --> 01:04:20.704
And so then I became

01:04:20.804 --> 01:04:22.626
respectful of the instrument,

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:24.027
and then the people who

01:04:24.047 --> 01:04:24.969
could play that way.

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:25.869
So yeah,

01:04:25.889 --> 01:04:27.911
that's been my kind of over time

01:04:27.992 --> 01:04:29.833
expanding into the other genres.

01:04:30.134 --> 01:04:30.974
But it all starts with the

01:04:31.355 --> 01:04:33.076
respect for the instruments

01:04:33.396 --> 01:04:34.717
and the artists that write

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:35.659
the music that goes with them.

01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:38.384
Right on.

01:04:38.423 --> 01:04:40.284
Mine was almost the exact

01:04:40.445 --> 01:04:41.166
opposite of that.

01:04:41.186 --> 01:04:42.907
Cause I had a, like growing up,

01:04:43.027 --> 01:04:44.628
I heard a lot of country

01:04:44.668 --> 01:04:46.489
music and like what's now

01:04:46.528 --> 01:04:47.730
called classic rock.

01:04:48.409 --> 01:04:49.391
And then later,

01:04:49.431 --> 01:04:53.634
whenever I started hearing hip hop, um,

01:04:53.713 --> 01:04:55.014
I picked up on the sampling, like,

01:04:55.295 --> 01:04:55.795
wait a minute,

01:04:55.894 --> 01:04:57.436
that's a Led Zeppelin riff

01:04:57.635 --> 01:04:58.737
or wait a minute,

01:04:58.757 --> 01:05:00.197
that's thirty eight special,

01:05:00.398 --> 01:05:01.838
which kind of then just

01:05:02.159 --> 01:05:03.940
forced me deeper down to that to see,

01:05:04.579 --> 01:05:05.701
well, if they're sampling that,

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.882
what else did they sample?

01:05:08.396 --> 01:05:09.637
You know what, when Run DMC,

01:05:09.677 --> 01:05:10.458
I forget what band they

01:05:10.478 --> 01:05:11.217
collaborated with.

01:05:11.778 --> 01:05:12.199
Aerosmith.

01:05:12.219 --> 01:05:13.480
Yeah, Aerosmith.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.882
And I should have known who

01:05:15.981 --> 01:05:17.844
Aerosmith was by then, but I didn't.

01:05:18.264 --> 01:05:19.704
And just see them at the same time,

01:05:19.724 --> 01:05:21.766
I was like, I like the way this sounds.

01:05:22.206 --> 01:05:22.967
And when I started listening

01:05:22.987 --> 01:05:25.070
to Rick Rubin and how he made music,

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.391
I think what made Rick Rubin so unique,

01:05:27.771 --> 01:05:29.592
he brought in those

01:05:29.753 --> 01:05:31.175
elements into hip hop.

01:05:31.815 --> 01:05:33.175
And so for a lot of hip hop artists,

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:34.456
that whole brand of music

01:05:34.476 --> 01:05:35.876
from Def Jam in those days,

01:05:36.396 --> 01:05:37.978
you were hearing this

01:05:38.137 --> 01:05:41.918
ultimate collaboration and crossover.

01:05:41.958 --> 01:05:42.378
For sure.

01:05:42.619 --> 01:05:42.818
Yeah.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.101
Rick Rubin was he was a very

01:05:47.619 --> 01:05:48.159
I don't know if you want to

01:05:48.179 --> 01:05:50.181
say forward thinking, but innovative,

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.443
like the way he just listened to music.

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:55.744
And then I think he was very

01:05:55.804 --> 01:05:57.286
instrumental in bringing

01:05:57.467 --> 01:05:58.666
those different genres

01:05:58.708 --> 01:05:59.907
together and letting them

01:06:00.409 --> 01:06:01.389
capitalize on what was

01:06:01.449 --> 01:06:03.130
successful from the others

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:12.398
and bring it into their own genre.

01:06:12.438 --> 01:06:12.958
All right.

01:06:13.018 --> 01:06:13.219
Well,

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.860
I kind of feel like we covered a few

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.501
topics here.

01:06:21.385 --> 01:06:22.367
You know what?

01:06:22.427 --> 01:06:24.550
We should cover AI.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.034
Oh, let's talk about AI.

01:06:26.815 --> 01:06:27.797
I've been seeing you post a

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.559
little bit on X. Yeah.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.346
So what you thinking?

01:06:34.284 --> 01:06:35.605
So like a lot of you all,

01:06:36.346 --> 01:06:38.706
when I saw early AI,

01:06:39.487 --> 01:06:40.108
like the stuff that's

01:06:40.128 --> 01:06:41.329
inside of your Google Maps,

01:06:41.929 --> 01:06:43.530
the stuff that's been in your Gmail,

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:45.092
the stuff that has been in

01:06:45.193 --> 01:06:46.554
a lot of your sensors and

01:06:46.594 --> 01:06:48.034
cameras and all of these things,

01:06:48.054 --> 01:06:49.335
like you've lived with this

01:06:50.096 --> 01:06:51.336
so much so that you don't

01:06:51.356 --> 01:06:53.318
even talk about AI anymore,

01:06:53.358 --> 01:06:54.159
just like we don't talk

01:06:54.179 --> 01:06:56.581
about syntax in the

01:06:56.661 --> 01:06:58.262
products that get shipped, right?

01:06:58.282 --> 01:06:59.163
It just becomes an

01:06:59.222 --> 01:07:00.463
ingredient of the whole.

01:07:01.425 --> 01:07:02.485
And so this resurgence of

01:07:02.545 --> 01:07:03.945
large language models, right?

01:07:03.985 --> 01:07:06.545
This would be your chat GPTs, you know,

01:07:06.585 --> 01:07:07.885
Lama from Meta.

01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:09.646
And these things are

01:07:09.706 --> 01:07:11.266
interesting because people

01:07:11.286 --> 01:07:12.027
are trying to build this

01:07:12.106 --> 01:07:14.507
general purpose tool that

01:07:14.547 --> 01:07:15.907
can interact largely with

01:07:15.927 --> 01:07:17.288
the language driven interface.

01:07:17.347 --> 01:07:18.268
And for a lot of people,

01:07:18.867 --> 01:07:19.768
they haven't made the

01:07:19.807 --> 01:07:20.708
connection on where this

01:07:20.748 --> 01:07:23.849
fits on the lineage of AI ML.

01:07:24.489 --> 01:07:26.349
But it's the first time that

01:07:26.369 --> 01:07:27.228
you're seeing something

01:07:27.268 --> 01:07:29.789
that looks like you do.

01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:30.389
Think about it.

01:07:31.141 --> 01:07:32.461
When we say prompt engineering,

01:07:32.501 --> 01:07:34.443
this idea of asking a thing,

01:07:35.483 --> 01:07:36.784
what is my birthday?

01:07:37.724 --> 01:07:40.186
It doesn't know because it has no context.

01:07:40.826 --> 01:07:41.827
It doesn't know who you are.

01:07:42.206 --> 01:07:44.208
Now, you could say, what's my birthday?

01:07:44.228 --> 01:07:45.869
What is Kelsey Hightower's birthday?

01:07:46.791 --> 01:07:49.492
And it's going to guess from what,

01:07:49.934 --> 01:07:51.735
from whatever it found on the internet.

01:07:51.855 --> 01:07:53.054
So that's its training set.

01:07:53.835 --> 01:07:54.976
But when you interact with

01:07:55.016 --> 01:07:55.836
something like that,

01:07:55.996 --> 01:07:57.416
it feels a lot how we

01:07:57.476 --> 01:07:58.438
interact with each other.

01:07:59.077 --> 01:07:59.778
I was reading somewhere

01:07:59.798 --> 01:08:00.619
earlier that it takes

01:08:00.679 --> 01:08:02.539
twenty watts of power for

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.701
your brain and your brain.

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:05.400
Look,

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.382
you don't know everything and you

01:08:07.402 --> 01:08:08.603
can't memorize everything.

01:08:08.722 --> 01:08:10.003
So that's your disadvantage.

01:08:10.623 --> 01:08:11.543
But your advantage is that

01:08:11.583 --> 01:08:12.505
you can generalize.

01:08:13.342 --> 01:08:14.802
Human with new problem on

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:15.884
twenty watts of power,

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:17.945
you can do with a room,

01:08:18.185 --> 01:08:19.967
a building full of the most

01:08:20.028 --> 01:08:21.087
expensive GPUs.

01:08:21.108 --> 01:08:23.449
We're talking kilowatts of

01:08:23.489 --> 01:08:25.452
power times in number of those units.

01:08:26.273 --> 01:08:26.472
Right.

01:08:26.533 --> 01:08:27.774
So you're a factor of

01:08:28.054 --> 01:08:29.935
multiples of what you can

01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:31.077
accomplish with real

01:08:31.117 --> 01:08:32.078
intelligence and the things

01:08:32.118 --> 01:08:32.837
we don't know yet.

01:08:33.679 --> 01:08:34.699
And so when I see people

01:08:34.779 --> 01:08:38.363
look at this new paradigm and it's scary.

01:08:39.382 --> 01:08:40.644
because the only thing we've

01:08:40.724 --> 01:08:43.024
seen interact this way are people.

01:08:43.925 --> 01:08:44.945
And for some reason,

01:08:46.105 --> 01:08:47.487
we put people at the

01:08:47.606 --> 01:08:49.207
highest part of the

01:08:49.247 --> 01:08:52.088
hierarchy in the galaxy, right?

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:53.408
People are at the top,

01:08:53.469 --> 01:08:54.489
the most intelligent,

01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:56.570
they can be dangerous, they can be safe,

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:58.150
they can be kind, they could be mean,

01:08:58.572 --> 01:08:59.391
they can be whatever.

01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:00.412
And we're usually only

01:09:00.471 --> 01:09:02.432
limited by our physical

01:09:02.472 --> 01:09:04.453
abilities or the machines

01:09:04.493 --> 01:09:06.055
we tend to operate.

01:09:06.715 --> 01:09:07.756
And you can fill in the gaps.

01:09:08.635 --> 01:09:09.576
And so when we say that

01:09:09.595 --> 01:09:11.237
we're going to generate a

01:09:11.296 --> 01:09:16.179
thing that's a void or void of ethics,

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.560
reason, purpose,

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.662
and give it access to all the power,

01:09:22.613 --> 01:09:25.355
and let it operate the same machines,

01:09:25.796 --> 01:09:26.716
we all get nervous.

01:09:27.097 --> 01:09:27.997
So in simpler terms,

01:09:28.037 --> 01:09:29.739
if you're in DevOps or you write code,

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:32.122
you're thinking to yourself, hmm,

01:09:32.242 --> 01:09:33.141
what do I do?

01:09:34.182 --> 01:09:35.524
And at a high level,

01:09:36.225 --> 01:09:37.765
you kind of get driven the same way.

01:09:38.225 --> 01:09:39.567
Someone opens a Jira ticket.

01:09:40.188 --> 01:09:42.248
I would like x. That's the prompt.

01:09:43.176 --> 01:09:44.818
You convert that prompt to

01:09:44.858 --> 01:09:46.460
the best of your ability.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:47.820
Remember that thing where

01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:48.541
you can't remember

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.863
everything and you haven't

01:09:49.882 --> 01:09:50.603
seen everything?

01:09:51.264 --> 01:09:52.625
Well, those LLMs are a little different.

01:09:53.865 --> 01:09:54.907
Usually they've seen it all.

01:09:55.386 --> 01:09:57.689
They've seen every repository on GitHub.

01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:59.610
And they're not biased.

01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:02.193
They don't care if it's Ruby or Java.

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:04.274
I've seen a lot of people who say,

01:10:04.293 --> 01:10:05.475
I will never touch anything

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:06.216
written in Java.

01:10:06.815 --> 01:10:07.356
Fair enough.

01:10:07.556 --> 01:10:09.399
That's your preference.

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:10.699
But that's not what that thing does.

01:10:11.819 --> 01:10:13.680
This thing learns everything

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.761
with very little bias

01:10:15.801 --> 01:10:17.203
except for the weights we create.

01:10:17.863 --> 01:10:19.783
And so those biases become the model,

01:10:20.444 --> 01:10:20.604
right?

01:10:20.644 --> 01:10:22.985
You have a model too, and your model,

01:10:24.047 --> 01:10:26.389
tends to go underinvested, right?

01:10:26.408 --> 01:10:27.069
So think about it.

01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:28.189
When we talk about like the

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:29.831
new version of these LLMs,

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:31.811
what we get excited about

01:10:31.851 --> 01:10:33.311
is the amount of maybe net

01:10:33.431 --> 01:10:35.974
new training data or unique training data,

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:37.793
plus all the work we put

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:39.414
into making the model and

01:10:39.475 --> 01:10:40.376
adjusting those little

01:10:40.416 --> 01:10:41.576
weights like dip switches

01:10:42.076 --> 01:10:43.617
to try to tune that model

01:10:44.277 --> 01:10:45.158
hopefully towards the

01:10:45.198 --> 01:10:46.738
correct answer or we're

01:10:46.778 --> 01:10:47.779
working towards the truth.

01:10:48.198 --> 01:10:49.039
So you put a natural

01:10:49.079 --> 01:10:50.680
language in front of this truth model,

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.381
hopefully it's truthful,

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.261
this is what you end up with

01:10:53.421 --> 01:10:54.421
now look they're far away

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.442
from that so that's one

01:10:55.462 --> 01:10:56.082
thing I want you to take

01:10:56.122 --> 01:10:57.702
comfort in what you do on

01:10:57.742 --> 01:10:59.882
twenty watts of power is

01:10:59.962 --> 01:11:01.082
much more efficient than

01:11:01.103 --> 01:11:03.023
what that thing does but

01:11:03.063 --> 01:11:04.103
your biases are probably

01:11:04.122 --> 01:11:05.543
holding you back so when

01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:07.323
people think that a lom

01:11:07.363 --> 01:11:08.344
like chat gpt is going to

01:11:08.363 --> 01:11:10.564
replace your job it could

01:11:11.265 --> 01:11:12.164
if you think of your job as

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:13.664
simply taking prompts from

01:11:13.725 --> 01:11:14.904
others and just doing

01:11:14.945 --> 01:11:17.065
things but what is your job

01:11:18.206 --> 01:11:20.447
Your job isn't to just do

01:11:20.466 --> 01:11:22.108
what people tell you and run commands.

01:11:22.347 --> 01:11:22.868
That's the thing we were

01:11:22.887 --> 01:11:23.688
talking about earlier.

01:11:24.349 --> 01:11:25.868
Your job is to form a better

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:28.250
model of the world, of your team,

01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:30.591
of your company, and your problem space.

01:11:30.872 --> 01:11:33.693
See, that model is hard to compete with.

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:36.118
What you currently have,

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:37.780
as long as you keep tuning that model,

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.862
you're going to be hyper competitive.

01:11:39.902 --> 01:11:41.564
And then here's the punch line.

01:11:42.344 --> 01:11:44.966
That thing is just a tool to

01:11:45.046 --> 01:11:47.088
complement your model.

01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:49.390
That's the trick here.

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:50.792
So a lot of people in DevOps,

01:11:51.842 --> 01:11:52.764
are really nervous,

01:11:52.904 --> 01:11:54.145
at least the ones I've talked to,

01:11:54.645 --> 01:11:55.065
number one,

01:11:55.086 --> 01:11:55.645
because I don't think they

01:11:55.666 --> 01:11:57.146
understand how this thing works.

01:11:57.927 --> 01:11:59.229
They haven't really walked

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:00.250
through the depths of what

01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:01.671
it's good at and what it's bad at.

01:12:02.091 --> 01:12:03.252
So there's just a bit of fear.

01:12:03.292 --> 01:12:04.493
Remember that thing we talked about,

01:12:04.533 --> 01:12:05.854
just the stream of stuff

01:12:05.873 --> 01:12:07.095
hitting people all the time,

01:12:07.755 --> 01:12:09.155
and things are just happening to them.

01:12:09.837 --> 01:12:10.597
So I really want people to

01:12:10.637 --> 01:12:11.717
rethink this AI thing.

01:12:11.738 --> 01:12:12.939
So when I was growing up,

01:12:13.439 --> 01:12:14.661
the last thing you wanted

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:18.404
was the artificial version of anything.

01:12:18.423 --> 01:12:19.645
The real version costs more.

01:12:20.612 --> 01:12:22.713
was real for a reason you're

01:12:22.753 --> 01:12:24.814
still the real version and

01:12:24.875 --> 01:12:25.695
I want you just to think

01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:26.697
about what the real version

01:12:26.737 --> 01:12:28.958
can do and I guarantee you

01:12:29.099 --> 01:12:31.239
it's under trained you

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.201
haven't thought about

01:12:32.862 --> 01:12:33.761
walking around with one of

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:34.403
the world's most

01:12:34.863 --> 01:12:36.944
sophisticated computing

01:12:36.984 --> 01:12:38.605
devices and also the

01:12:38.645 --> 01:12:39.827
world's most efficient

01:12:40.528 --> 01:12:42.368
computing devices if you

01:12:42.469 --> 01:12:43.449
thought about it that way

01:12:44.587 --> 01:12:44.728
right,

01:12:44.747 --> 01:12:46.167
the same effort that NVIDIA puts

01:12:46.207 --> 01:12:48.248
into the next GPU release,

01:12:48.588 --> 01:12:50.189
the same effort OpenAI puts

01:12:50.208 --> 01:12:51.429
into the next model release.

01:12:52.009 --> 01:12:55.010
Imagine if you put in a

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:57.310
fraction of that effort to

01:12:57.390 --> 01:13:00.011
training your model and

01:13:00.051 --> 01:13:02.171
then releasing that on your colleagues,

01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:04.032
the world, your family, and yourself.

01:13:04.532 --> 01:13:05.912
So that's kind of my thoughts on AI.

01:13:06.072 --> 01:13:07.171
It's so important,

01:13:07.431 --> 01:13:08.193
not because you need to

01:13:08.313 --> 01:13:09.453
figure out what's the best model.

01:13:10.765 --> 01:13:12.666
Just remind yourself that you got one too,

01:13:13.206 --> 01:13:17.948
and it's also worth investing in.

01:13:18.009 --> 01:13:18.349
Right on.

01:13:18.569 --> 01:13:19.128
Fair point.

01:13:19.849 --> 01:13:28.413
I think for me,

01:13:28.793 --> 01:13:30.274
I've been using it as

01:13:30.375 --> 01:13:32.735
almost just like a

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:34.856
colleague to bounce ideas off of.

01:13:36.225 --> 01:13:37.787
You know, whenever I'm,

01:13:37.828 --> 01:13:40.270
whenever I get the JIRA ticket and like,

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.672
oh, I'm thinking about doing this,

01:13:42.172 --> 01:13:42.432
you know,

01:13:42.533 --> 01:13:45.417
I will use it as something to

01:13:45.817 --> 01:13:47.338
bounce ideas off of because

01:13:47.378 --> 01:13:48.761
it has such a larger set to

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.063
work with and see what

01:13:50.122 --> 01:13:52.225
other ideas it has for

01:13:52.265 --> 01:13:53.407
solving that problem that I

01:13:53.466 --> 01:13:54.488
hadn't thought of.

01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.349
But.

01:13:57.492 --> 01:13:58.533
I tend to agree with you

01:13:58.552 --> 01:13:59.912
that I don't think it's at

01:13:59.993 --> 01:14:03.274
a human replacement capability.

01:14:04.635 --> 01:14:06.296
For most scenarios,

01:14:06.315 --> 01:14:07.015
I think there are some

01:14:07.036 --> 01:14:08.117
where it probably could.

01:14:08.556 --> 01:14:09.777
But for me personally,

01:14:09.877 --> 01:14:11.257
which is all I can speak to

01:14:11.677 --> 01:14:13.198
my job is to solve problems.

01:14:13.519 --> 01:14:16.020
And even whenever it starts

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:17.240
solving the problems that

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:19.962
I'm currently tasked with solving now,

01:14:20.002 --> 01:14:21.421
that just means I'm free to

01:14:21.462 --> 01:14:23.002
go find other problems to solve.

01:14:24.158 --> 01:14:24.939
And the other thing I try to

01:14:24.979 --> 01:14:26.500
think about is a lot of the

01:14:26.539 --> 01:14:28.240
tools we have don't have

01:14:28.301 --> 01:14:30.761
good APIs or interfaces of

01:14:30.801 --> 01:14:31.382
interacting with them.

01:14:31.403 --> 01:14:32.884
Let's just think about this for a second.

01:14:34.085 --> 01:14:34.824
In the cloud,

01:14:34.885 --> 01:14:35.826
there are thousands of

01:14:35.886 --> 01:14:37.907
resources with thousands of parameters.

01:14:38.426 --> 01:14:39.908
It's impossible to find the

01:14:39.948 --> 01:14:41.328
right permutation of those

01:14:41.349 --> 01:14:42.010
things together.

01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:43.371
So what are we given?

01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:47.212
Pulumi, Terraform, Puppet Chef, Ansible.

01:14:47.693 --> 01:14:48.394
And these are fine,

01:14:48.793 --> 01:14:49.534
but they're almost

01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:52.497
one-to-one leaking all of those details.

01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:54.480
They just give you a way to

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.962
express your choices in their language.

01:14:58.302 --> 01:14:59.363
But you still have to be

01:14:59.444 --> 01:15:01.645
exposed to all of this detail.

01:15:02.746 --> 01:15:04.046
And so that's just a very

01:15:04.487 --> 01:15:06.347
static way of solving problems.

01:15:06.448 --> 01:15:06.969
It works.

01:15:07.389 --> 01:15:08.569
You know, we solve the problem once,

01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:09.529
we go through all the pain.

01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:10.350
We still don't know if we're

01:15:10.371 --> 01:15:11.350
making the right decision,

01:15:12.051 --> 01:15:13.412
but we at least will make a decision,

01:15:13.733 --> 01:15:14.693
form consensus,

01:15:15.134 --> 01:15:16.373
and then we write it down

01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:19.055
in HCL and say terraform apply.

01:15:19.475 --> 01:15:20.356
Nothing wrong with that.

01:15:21.411 --> 01:15:22.791
But the interface is not good.

01:15:23.971 --> 01:15:25.032
I used to work at a cloud provider.

01:15:25.072 --> 01:15:26.091
What should the interface be?

01:15:26.631 --> 01:15:27.511
The interface should be,

01:15:28.332 --> 01:15:30.932
I need a database that can

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:32.372
hold this amount of data.

01:15:33.413 --> 01:15:34.354
And I need it in this

01:15:34.394 --> 01:15:36.474
particular reason because

01:15:36.514 --> 01:15:38.295
of these particular compliance laws.

01:15:39.015 --> 01:15:39.975
And I also need a set of

01:15:40.015 --> 01:15:41.815
credentials that only let these apps.

01:15:42.275 --> 01:15:43.475
That's how we would think about this.

01:15:44.318 --> 01:15:45.797
So imagine I take that and

01:15:45.918 --> 01:15:46.838
give it to the system.

01:15:47.618 --> 01:15:48.798
That's enough information to

01:15:48.838 --> 01:15:50.800
set up a VPC in the right

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.319
zone or region with the

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.360
right set of credentials,

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:54.780
lock everything else out,

01:15:55.421 --> 01:15:56.822
generate the IAM components,

01:15:57.181 --> 01:15:58.141
make them available,

01:15:58.521 --> 01:15:59.783
and then return back to someone,

01:16:00.002 --> 01:16:01.122
your database is ready,

01:16:02.203 --> 01:16:03.823
here are the IAM accounts that can log in,

01:16:04.844 --> 01:16:06.305
the IP address is over here,

01:16:06.984 --> 01:16:08.064
you're at this version,

01:16:08.645 --> 01:16:10.086
and it meets all the compliance things.

01:16:11.326 --> 01:16:12.287
So what does that tell you?

01:16:12.346 --> 01:16:13.046
It tells you that

01:16:14.261 --> 01:16:15.101
the systems that we

01:16:15.141 --> 01:16:17.823
currently target don't have great APIs.

01:16:18.765 --> 01:16:19.505
And so when I think about

01:16:19.524 --> 01:16:20.565
what LLMs do and what

01:16:20.605 --> 01:16:22.207
fascinates me the most is

01:16:22.306 --> 01:16:23.568
they tend to bring a much

01:16:23.609 --> 01:16:26.631
better API to the systems

01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:27.511
we interact with,

01:16:27.572 --> 01:16:29.153
at least in that specific domain.

01:16:29.693 --> 01:16:31.194
And the thing that made me

01:16:31.274 --> 01:16:32.595
less scared of what it does

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:34.676
is the machine that it

01:16:34.737 --> 01:16:37.739
targets is still roughly the same, right?

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.180
Because it takes your prompt

01:16:39.701 --> 01:16:41.082
and it translates that into

01:16:41.143 --> 01:16:42.623
something that it can understand,

01:16:44.011 --> 01:16:44.992
if I can use that word.

01:16:45.832 --> 01:16:46.653
And then it still has to

01:16:46.693 --> 01:16:49.175
manipulate the same underlying machine.

01:16:49.875 --> 01:16:51.256
The cloud provider is still the same.

01:16:51.756 --> 01:16:53.136
The load balancer is still the same.

01:16:53.337 --> 01:16:55.378
The config is still the same.

01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:57.380
It's just that the model for

01:16:57.541 --> 01:16:58.280
gluing these things

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.382
together is refined or can

01:17:01.443 --> 01:17:04.265
be refined to the point

01:17:04.284 --> 01:17:05.405
where we can get people a

01:17:05.466 --> 01:17:07.247
more natural interface,

01:17:07.587 --> 01:17:09.229
hence large language models.

01:17:09.668 --> 01:17:10.710
And so that's the part where

01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:11.711
I'm now going back and

01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:13.412
looking at all my tools and saying,

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:15.969
What would a better API be?

01:17:15.988 --> 01:17:18.070
We've been so locked into it

01:17:18.131 --> 01:17:21.273
has to have a RESTful API, get, put, post,

01:17:21.292 --> 01:17:23.675
delete, JSON object.

01:17:24.154 --> 01:17:24.895
What is that?

01:17:25.296 --> 01:17:26.176
I have to leak all the

01:17:26.237 --> 01:17:26.997
details about how the

01:17:27.037 --> 01:17:30.220
machine works versus a high-level API.

01:17:30.859 --> 01:17:32.400
And I think that new high-level API,

01:17:32.421 --> 01:17:33.442
the thing we've always been

01:17:33.481 --> 01:17:35.264
afraid to do because of composability,

01:17:35.863 --> 01:17:37.045
a high-level API,

01:17:37.284 --> 01:17:38.206
whether it's using a large

01:17:38.246 --> 01:17:39.367
language model or not,

01:17:39.966 --> 01:17:41.568
you can still take the same expression

01:17:42.488 --> 01:17:43.850
and just really combine

01:17:43.869 --> 01:17:45.270
things using the best practice.

01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:45.890
And I think that's what a

01:17:45.930 --> 01:17:47.011
lot of people in DevOps do

01:17:47.372 --> 01:17:48.872
with our golden paths, right?

01:17:49.453 --> 01:17:51.154
If you do things with these inputs,

01:17:51.534 --> 01:17:53.095
we already know how to wire

01:17:53.176 --> 01:17:54.856
up a better machine so you

01:17:54.877 --> 01:17:58.899
don't have to piece it together yourself.

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:01.501
I think a specific example

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.342
that resonates with me on

01:18:03.382 --> 01:18:04.582
that is least privileged

01:18:04.622 --> 01:18:06.203
security with cloud providers,

01:18:06.224 --> 01:18:07.364
because like everyone is like,

01:18:09.231 --> 01:18:10.012
least privileged security,

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:10.975
least privileged security,

01:18:10.994 --> 01:18:12.898
but every piece of documentation,

01:18:13.298 --> 01:18:14.942
every being a relative word, of course,

01:18:15.322 --> 01:18:16.644
every piece of documentation,

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.801
references admin privileges

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:20.640
when implementing it.

01:18:20.661 --> 01:18:21.582
And so you're in this

01:18:22.181 --> 01:18:23.823
iterative loop that lasts

01:18:23.863 --> 01:18:25.363
for hours of trying to

01:18:25.382 --> 01:18:27.024
figure out which permissions you need.

01:18:27.743 --> 01:18:29.225
And I think something like, you know,

01:18:29.345 --> 01:18:30.605
a well-trained LLM,

01:18:30.926 --> 01:18:31.725
you can tell it which

01:18:31.765 --> 01:18:34.367
permissions you want it to have.

01:18:34.386 --> 01:18:37.088
And then it returns the IAM

01:18:37.128 --> 01:18:38.368
roles that you need to

01:18:38.429 --> 01:18:40.550
implement without spending

01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:43.431
hours beating your head against the wall.

01:18:43.471 --> 01:18:43.551
Yeah.

01:18:43.572 --> 01:18:44.212
We're going to get out.

01:18:45.478 --> 01:18:48.121
What LLMs are teaching me is

01:18:48.161 --> 01:18:49.622
that when you design these systems,

01:18:49.662 --> 01:18:51.364
you can't design them in isolation.

01:18:51.886 --> 01:18:53.547
You have to be aware of context.

01:18:54.288 --> 01:18:55.250
And this is why I think when

01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:56.451
you say neural nets and the

01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:57.372
network that goes,

01:18:57.412 --> 01:18:58.514
it's that shared context

01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:00.195
that these things have and

01:19:00.216 --> 01:19:01.556
their ability to try things

01:19:01.577 --> 01:19:03.340
until they find the perfect combination

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:05.180
But again, I can't stress enough,

01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:06.680
a lot of these systems are tuned.

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:08.041
So they're guessing.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.921
And when they're wrong, we can tune them.

01:19:11.381 --> 01:19:14.582
And then we have a much more dynamic,

01:19:15.341 --> 01:19:17.242
expressive system and framework.

01:19:17.582 --> 01:19:18.643
So if you learn anything

01:19:18.662 --> 01:19:19.962
from this whole chapter of

01:19:20.203 --> 01:19:22.722
LLMs and this movement, number one,

01:19:22.783 --> 01:19:24.064
we can build better systems.

01:19:24.503 --> 01:19:25.863
We can give them better APIs

01:19:25.884 --> 01:19:26.703
and interfaces.

01:19:27.203 --> 01:19:29.885
And it will feel like Skynet,

01:19:30.664 --> 01:19:31.925
even though it won't be.

01:19:35.932 --> 01:19:37.613
He wants to intentionally scare people.

01:19:38.373 --> 01:19:41.354
I mean, I do a lot packed in there.

01:19:41.595 --> 01:19:42.695
Realistically, I mean,

01:19:42.716 --> 01:19:43.376
I think there's something

01:19:43.576 --> 01:19:46.016
very on point about how

01:19:46.337 --> 01:19:47.756
we've been developing maybe

01:19:47.796 --> 01:19:49.238
not even an API effectively,

01:19:49.278 --> 01:19:50.478
but really the protocol.

01:19:51.538 --> 01:19:52.698
We're just doing a better

01:19:52.738 --> 01:19:54.699
job exposing what you have

01:19:54.739 --> 01:19:56.060
access to and never really

01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:58.320
sort of abstracted it away

01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.322
in a way which actually

01:19:59.341 --> 01:20:00.101
really makes sense.

01:20:03.274 --> 01:20:04.094
I think that's a really good

01:20:04.134 --> 01:20:05.295
way of looking at it.

01:20:05.475 --> 01:20:06.515
It's just an abstraction

01:20:06.534 --> 01:20:09.756
layer that is more suited

01:20:09.796 --> 01:20:11.396
towards talking to humans

01:20:12.256 --> 01:20:13.596
than a REST API is.

01:20:14.198 --> 01:20:16.037
I don't know if I'll agree with that part.

01:20:16.097 --> 01:20:16.898
It's sometimes very

01:20:16.938 --> 01:20:18.038
challenging for me to get

01:20:18.179 --> 01:20:20.380
LLMs to spit back out what

01:20:20.859 --> 01:20:22.880
I'm looking for in a reasonable way.

01:20:23.079 --> 01:20:24.301
I know other people are much

01:20:24.341 --> 01:20:25.621
better than myself,

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:26.782
but there is something

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:27.801
challenging about the

01:20:28.021 --> 01:20:29.421
natural way in which humans

01:20:29.442 --> 01:20:30.863
speak and then get that

01:20:31.519 --> 01:20:32.759
Converted into what's been

01:20:32.779 --> 01:20:33.880
seen on the internet into a

01:20:33.899 --> 01:20:35.619
relative common form.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.220
So we're making progress.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:37.501
You know,

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.421
I think that's the way I kind of

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:38.780
look at it.

01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:39.680
We're making progress.

01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:42.162
Like SQL was a huge progress

01:20:43.021 --> 01:20:45.323
on structured data and how

01:20:45.342 --> 01:20:47.143
we get at it and insert it.

01:20:47.662 --> 01:20:48.604
And then trying to do that

01:20:48.623 --> 01:20:49.623
with natural natural

01:20:49.663 --> 01:20:51.144
language is a little more challenging,

01:20:51.283 --> 01:20:51.925
especially when these

01:20:51.944 --> 01:20:52.885
things aren't tuned.

01:20:53.324 --> 01:20:53.505
Uh,

01:20:53.524 --> 01:20:55.265
but we're making progress and in the

01:20:55.305 --> 01:20:57.286
highlights, uh, an area of opportunity.

01:20:57.796 --> 01:20:58.115
Yeah, I mean,

01:20:58.155 --> 01:20:59.738
I think we're right now in

01:20:59.778 --> 01:21:01.878
the sort of map phase where

01:21:01.899 --> 01:21:03.199
we're seeing everything it can do.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:04.501
And very quickly,

01:21:04.542 --> 01:21:05.641
we're also going to see the

01:21:05.681 --> 01:21:07.963
reduced cycle where very

01:21:08.345 --> 01:21:10.086
specific use cases have a

01:21:10.145 --> 01:21:11.386
much better interface for

01:21:11.447 --> 01:21:13.168
interacting with them as we

01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:14.930
identify what it's optimized for.

01:21:15.210 --> 01:21:16.011
And we've already gone that

01:21:16.051 --> 01:21:18.092
far with whether it's good or bad,

01:21:18.132 --> 01:21:18.372
you know,

01:21:18.393 --> 01:21:20.213
it's still a question of content

01:21:20.253 --> 01:21:22.055
generation for words,

01:21:22.155 --> 01:21:24.518
audio and video and images like

01:21:24.978 --> 01:21:26.742
We know that that's a pretty good use case,

01:21:26.761 --> 01:21:27.804
so we've improved the

01:21:27.884 --> 01:21:29.587
interface there much more

01:21:30.288 --> 01:21:32.073
rather than interacting with just text.

01:21:32.875 --> 01:21:33.975
You know what I want?

01:21:34.395 --> 01:21:36.697
I'm personally less excited

01:21:36.716 --> 01:21:38.318
about the generation.

01:21:38.358 --> 01:21:39.377
Maybe for things I can't do,

01:21:39.438 --> 01:21:40.338
like I can't draw,

01:21:40.519 --> 01:21:41.899
so something that can help me draw,

01:21:41.998 --> 01:21:42.520
no problem.

01:21:43.039 --> 01:21:44.079
But for things like this,

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.740
where we're talking into

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:47.202
these mics and you have

01:21:47.221 --> 01:21:48.922
varying degrees of background noise,

01:21:48.943 --> 01:21:49.743
and it's hard to get the

01:21:49.802 --> 01:21:52.685
levels just perfect, just like,

01:21:52.824 --> 01:21:53.524
you know how sometimes you

01:21:53.604 --> 01:21:54.706
use a really good plug-in

01:21:54.765 --> 01:21:56.105
or audio plug-in or filter

01:21:56.485 --> 01:21:57.506
and just makes it sound better?

01:21:57.966 --> 01:21:59.787
Just give everyone NPR

01:21:59.847 --> 01:22:01.429
Studio-level quality

01:22:01.969 --> 01:22:03.029
from any mic, right?

01:22:03.149 --> 01:22:04.750
I'm already generating the content.

01:22:04.789 --> 01:22:05.911
Don't waste cycles doing that.

01:22:06.730 --> 01:22:08.992
Just make the audio sound perfect.

01:22:09.712 --> 01:22:09.872
Right?

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:11.432
The thing that I've already generated,

01:22:11.832 --> 01:22:13.253
just make it perfect.

01:22:13.293 --> 01:22:14.634
So anyone enhancement is

01:22:14.694 --> 01:22:15.574
probably what I'm really

01:22:16.135 --> 01:22:16.895
looking forward to.

01:22:17.194 --> 01:22:20.457
So that's the highest thing on my radar.

01:22:20.497 --> 01:22:20.896
Pause.

01:22:22.136 --> 01:22:23.917
I do have a meeting in two minutes.

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:25.519
I just realized it from my calendar.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.079
Fair enough.

01:22:28.159 --> 01:22:28.319
Well,

01:22:29.451 --> 01:22:30.872
Thank you so much for your time, man.

01:22:30.931 --> 01:22:31.391
I really,

01:22:31.452 --> 01:22:32.533
really appreciate you taking the

01:22:32.552 --> 01:22:33.533
time to talk with us.

01:22:33.894 --> 01:22:35.033
I've enjoyed it a lot.

01:22:36.114 --> 01:22:37.975
And you are more than

01:22:38.015 --> 01:22:39.697
welcome to come back at any point.

01:22:39.756 --> 01:22:40.597
Would love to have you back on.

01:22:41.677 --> 01:22:41.877
Awesome.

01:22:41.898 --> 01:22:42.918
Well, thanks for having me.

01:22:42.979 --> 01:22:43.619
This is dope.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.939
And I also like your all's

01:22:45.159 --> 01:22:46.461
interview style and format.

01:22:47.261 --> 01:22:47.681
As you know,

01:22:47.721 --> 01:22:49.922
the hosts bring out the best

01:22:50.143 --> 01:22:51.663
in the particular interview

01:22:51.684 --> 01:22:52.965
or a person being interviewed.

01:22:53.586 --> 01:22:54.466
So I just wanted to give a

01:22:54.485 --> 01:22:55.126
shout out to you all.

01:22:55.206 --> 01:22:55.926
It felt really nice.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:57.042
Awesome.

01:22:57.162 --> 01:22:57.903
Thank you, Kelsey.

01:22:58.104 --> 01:23:00.328
Have a great day, and thank you, everyone,

01:23:00.349 --> 01:23:00.890
for listening.

01:23:01.331 --> 01:23:02.594
I hope you all enjoyed the episode,

01:23:02.654 --> 01:23:04.297
and we will see you all next week.
