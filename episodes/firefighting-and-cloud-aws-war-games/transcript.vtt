WEBVTT

00:00:01.322 --> 00:00:01.703
There we go.

00:00:02.323 --> 00:00:03.084
What's up, everyone?

00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:04.264
Welcome to another episode

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:06.447
of Adventures in DevOps.

00:00:07.548 --> 00:00:09.169
Warren, thanks for joining me again.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.609
Yeah,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.910
I think you don't need to thank me

00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:13.573
every time I decide to show up.

00:00:14.173 --> 00:00:15.073
I know we said that we were

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:16.535
going to have maybe a cool

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:18.135
fact at the beginning of every episode,

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:19.157
and I try to come up with one,

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:20.638
although I do believe last

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:22.539
time Jillian committed to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.942
bringing the fact.

00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:26.001
Maybe it's a coincidence

00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:27.263
that she's just not here today.

00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:30.024
I will have to step in and

00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:30.786
share something.

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:33.127
I forgot the pin for my

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:35.607
backup phone and I didn't

00:00:35.628 --> 00:00:36.789
remember how many digits it was.

00:00:36.948 --> 00:00:37.630
And on Android,

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.390
apparently you can keep going forever.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.832
So I was on one hundred and

00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:41.531
fifty attempts.

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:44.613
of trying to guess what this

00:00:44.654 --> 00:00:45.634
pin is and it wasn't like

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:46.716
like I have no I don't care

00:00:46.735 --> 00:00:48.015
about factory resetting it

00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:49.398
but you know I just wanted

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:50.398
to see like can I get it

00:00:50.677 --> 00:00:51.838
and actually a hundred and

00:00:51.878 --> 00:00:53.380
fifty one I finally got it

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.002
I had up the pit the pin

00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:57.543
size to twelve digits and

00:00:57.683 --> 00:00:59.045
like that was like a

00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:00.326
realization for me so you

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:00.905
know if you forget your

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:01.947
android pin just keep

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.728
trying there's there's no

00:01:03.747 --> 00:01:04.429
there's no time I mean

00:01:04.448 --> 00:01:05.129
there's a thirty second

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.051
timeout prep um per attempt

00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:07.811
but other than that you

00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:09.793
just keep going so is that

00:01:09.813 --> 00:01:12.234
like manual brute force attack

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:14.712
Is that the category this would fall into?

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.412
Yeah, for sure.

00:01:17.174 --> 00:01:18.614
Right on.

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:18.956
Cool.

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:20.716
I'm excited about today's episode.

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:22.156
Joining us today,

00:01:22.257 --> 00:01:23.957
we have Matt Lea from

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:28.260
Schematical and from cloudwargames.com.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.061
Looking at your background here, Matt,

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:34.043
co-founder of drawnby.ai,

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:37.206
author of shiporgetoffthepot.com,

00:01:37.787 --> 00:01:39.668
and then gymnastics coach

00:01:39.707 --> 00:01:41.269
for eighteen years.

00:01:42.608 --> 00:01:44.750
and out of Madison, Wisconsin.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.490
Welcome Matt.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.691
Thanks.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.251
Thanks for having me.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.471
Yeah.

00:01:49.712 --> 00:01:50.912
Um, yeah, shipper get off the pod.com.

00:01:50.992 --> 00:01:53.974
I'm not doing any more, but, uh, the, um,

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:55.034
I actually did write a book

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:56.615
on coaching gymnastics called hacking,

00:01:56.635 --> 00:01:57.936
fear, tips, tricks, and strategies,

00:01:57.977 --> 00:01:59.218
how to help high performing

00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:00.597
athletes through mental issues.

00:02:00.798 --> 00:02:01.918
So fun facts.

00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:03.251
Right on.

00:02:03.412 --> 00:02:06.073
My youngest son did gymnastics from,

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:07.174
I think,

00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:09.856
from when he was about ten all

00:02:09.877 --> 00:02:11.837
the way up until his senior

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:12.998
year in high school.

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.960
And his senior year, I mean,

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:16.080
you're probably well aware of this,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.122
like the number of

00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:20.544
collegiate positions for

00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:23.825
men's gymnastics is very, very small.

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:25.647
And so he knew that that

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:26.828
wasn't going to get him

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:28.909
anywhere and he wanted to participate and

00:02:29.597 --> 00:02:31.617
some kind of activity at

00:02:31.677 --> 00:02:35.580
school because for his entire education,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.881
he would get out of school,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.882
his mom would be waiting in

00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:39.882
the parking lot and she

00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:41.903
would drive him an hour to

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:43.424
the gymnastics facility and

00:02:43.443 --> 00:02:44.564
he would work out for four

00:02:44.604 --> 00:02:46.506
hours doing his homework in the car.

00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:49.086
And that was his life growing up.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:49.907
So his senior year,

00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:50.788
he wanted to do something

00:02:50.807 --> 00:02:52.568
that was school related and

00:02:52.588 --> 00:02:53.689
that was the end of his

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:54.650
gymnastics career.

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:55.890
But it's a commitment and

00:02:55.911 --> 00:02:57.532
there's so much mental to it.

00:02:59.243 --> 00:03:00.745
Absolutely.

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:02.885
Yeah, it's not an uncommon story.

00:03:02.925 --> 00:03:03.485
Unfortunately,

00:03:03.526 --> 00:03:05.287
men's gymnastics is just not

00:03:05.306 --> 00:03:06.587
doing as well these days.

00:03:06.608 --> 00:03:08.008
Too many competitors, this sport,

00:03:08.108 --> 00:03:08.788
parkour and other things.

00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:10.528
Right, for sure.

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:10.930
Yeah.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.270
And I think the commitment

00:03:13.311 --> 00:03:16.671
to it just kind of kind of

00:03:16.692 --> 00:03:19.293
just like self filters, you know,

00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:20.454
so that when you do get to

00:03:20.493 --> 00:03:21.914
those people that are there,

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:23.074
you've got some very

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:24.436
committed individuals.

00:03:25.844 --> 00:03:27.885
Yeah, you play football, you play soccer,

00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:29.227
no one plays gymnastics.

00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:29.907
Right.

00:03:30.227 --> 00:03:33.468
Fair point.

00:03:33.508 --> 00:03:33.808
Cool.

00:03:33.848 --> 00:03:36.349
So tell us a little bit about,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.570
actually first,

00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:40.812
it looks like you've been

00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:42.652
in Wisconsin for a long time.

00:03:42.693 --> 00:03:43.753
Are you a Wisconsin native?

00:03:44.454 --> 00:03:45.373
Yeah, born and raised.

00:03:45.394 --> 00:03:46.555
I've traveled the world,

00:03:46.594 --> 00:03:48.116
but I keep coming back here

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:51.176
and about four years settled down,

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:52.538
bought a house out in the countryside,

00:03:52.557 --> 00:03:53.497
a little north of Madison.

00:03:54.972 --> 00:03:56.032
and been loving it.

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:56.393
Right on.

00:03:56.954 --> 00:03:58.174
Madison is fantastic.

00:03:58.495 --> 00:03:59.694
I lived there for two years,

00:03:59.895 --> 00:04:02.317
and I will say that I love

00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:03.798
being there in the summer.

00:04:04.998 --> 00:04:07.819
That's the only qualifier that I find.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.700
Summer and fall, yeah.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.122
You can get this time of year,

00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:12.682
and that is nice.

00:04:12.703 --> 00:04:14.003
What's your current temperature today?

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:16.505
Oh, it's actually really nice.

00:04:16.545 --> 00:04:17.485
I was on site earlier.

00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:18.567
I let the dogs out,

00:04:18.627 --> 00:04:20.108
and I do some jumping jacks to wake up,

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:21.848
get myself ready for the podcast, and

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.062
Got to be around ten degrees.

00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:25.201
So it's actually very

00:04:25.221 --> 00:04:26.182
pleasant compared to the

00:04:26.202 --> 00:04:29.043
year twenty we were close to a week ago.

00:04:29.444 --> 00:04:30.324
Yeah, that's balmy.

00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:33.565
Right on.

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:34.807
So cloud.

00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:37.267
I'm going to mess up the name.

00:04:37.648 --> 00:04:38.889
Damn it.

00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:39.629
Sorry about that.

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:41.189
Cloudwargames.com.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.651
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.072
And don't feel bad about

00:04:44.112 --> 00:04:44.752
messing with the games.

00:04:44.812 --> 00:04:45.872
I keep calling it Cloud

00:04:45.932 --> 00:04:47.833
Watch Games because I'm so used to it.

00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:48.973
I stay with Cloud Watch all

00:04:49.014 --> 00:04:51.055
day long on AWS, Amazon Web Services.

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.230
and uh you know with cloud

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.130
war games yeah so this um

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.432
goes back a little bit if

00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:57.872
you don't mind me going

00:04:57.891 --> 00:04:59.552
back I had a team I was

00:04:59.793 --> 00:05:00.793
running uh I think I had

00:05:00.812 --> 00:05:02.093
like eleven people on staff

00:05:02.213 --> 00:05:03.514
and I was I needed to come

00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:05.654
up with a training um idea

00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:06.995
a project for that so I've

00:05:07.134 --> 00:05:07.774
come up with a couple

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:09.375
different games over the

00:05:09.396 --> 00:05:10.435
years and different tools

00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:12.057
to help out my devs and so

00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:13.677
one of them was the

00:05:13.716 --> 00:05:14.997
predecessor to cloudboard

00:05:15.017 --> 00:05:16.077
games which is where I

00:05:16.098 --> 00:05:18.218
would take a whiteboard and draw

00:05:25.177 --> 00:05:26.677
and dragon-style game with them.

00:05:27.178 --> 00:05:27.959
And what I did,

00:05:27.978 --> 00:05:29.560
besides just writing down

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.380
all these different things,

00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:32.682
is I had hundreds of

00:05:32.822 --> 00:05:34.704
scenarios of things that

00:05:34.723 --> 00:05:35.985
had gone horribly wrong

00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:37.665
over the years that I would

00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:38.507
then throw at them.

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:39.827
And I'd say something like,

00:05:39.848 --> 00:05:42.389
I'd give them a brief,

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.211
which would be like, all of a sudden,

00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:45.951
your website's timing out.

00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.432
You know, what is that?

00:05:47.752 --> 00:05:49.093
And they'd have to walk

00:05:49.113 --> 00:05:49.975
through and tell me how

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:51.076
they wanted to solve it.

00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:52.617
And so this one, in this case,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.180
all rule from one of the

00:06:00.221 --> 00:06:01.442
various instances or

00:06:01.502 --> 00:06:03.002
resources running there and

00:06:03.103 --> 00:06:04.002
sort of time out.

00:06:04.062 --> 00:06:05.363
So I've got all these other

00:06:05.463 --> 00:06:06.845
ones incident cannot deploy.

00:06:07.165 --> 00:06:07.904
And so it's, you know,

00:06:07.925 --> 00:06:08.524
you don't get a lot of

00:06:08.545 --> 00:06:09.526
information a lot of times

00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:10.286
when people come to you

00:06:10.305 --> 00:06:11.747
saying there's a problem.

00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:12.466
Like at the time it's

00:06:12.487 --> 00:06:16.149
customer service person saying our guys,

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.649
you know,

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.009
our shopping cart is

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:19.591
disappearing randomly for

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.672
our e-commerce store.

00:06:20.752 --> 00:06:21.451
People all of a sudden the

00:06:21.492 --> 00:06:23.913
shopping cart's empty, you know,

00:06:23.952 --> 00:06:25.613
so using that,

00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:30.927
master.

00:06:31.146 --> 00:06:32.687
And it was a pretty good training tool.

00:06:33.108 --> 00:06:34.829
You can really figure out who was,

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.630
you know, thinking outside the box,

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.370
who was like really

00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:39.572
analytical or who just kind of,

00:06:39.612 --> 00:06:41.692
I don't know, you know,

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:42.492
it turned out to be a great

00:06:42.512 --> 00:06:43.454
sales tool as well.

00:06:43.793 --> 00:06:44.754
You walk the client through

00:06:44.774 --> 00:06:47.336
this and they're like, that can go wrong.

00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:50.778
Like that can happen.

00:06:50.798 --> 00:06:51.918
You're like, yeah, I can.

00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:52.579
What would you do?

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:53.158
I don't know.

00:06:53.418 --> 00:06:54.119
I guess I'd call you.

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:55.819
All right.

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:57.281
So that is how it started.

00:06:57.841 --> 00:06:58.802
Then, uh,

00:06:59.079 --> 00:06:59.939
Literally last Thursday,

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:01.040
I was on a mastermind group,

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.702
and I was talking about some goals I got.

00:07:04.742 --> 00:07:05.382
I was going to launch a

00:07:05.403 --> 00:07:06.964
community for people to

00:07:07.024 --> 00:07:07.805
want to learn AWS.

00:07:08.305 --> 00:07:09.766
I was telling them about my

00:07:09.807 --> 00:07:10.706
idea for WarGames,

00:07:10.726 --> 00:07:11.728
which is where we spin up

00:07:11.807 --> 00:07:13.009
actual infrastructure,

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:14.189
like AWS infrastructure.

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:15.430
Because we've got infrastructure as code.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.810
It's not like I have to manually do this.

00:07:16.831 --> 00:07:17.591
I just spin it up,

00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:21.093
and then I basically knock

00:07:21.113 --> 00:07:22.334
down a part of it or fill

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:24.456
up a database or remove a

00:07:24.497 --> 00:07:25.937
security group or something

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.718
or DDoS attack myself for the fun of it.

00:07:28.478 --> 00:07:32.100
And then people will, the participants,

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:33.021
the hot seat participants,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.521
which people with their cameras on,

00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:35.141
ideally,

00:07:35.641 --> 00:07:38.762
will be sitting there and they'll be like,

00:07:38.903 --> 00:07:40.463
hey, they'll try and fix it.

00:07:40.903 --> 00:07:42.283
And there's a couple different variables.

00:07:42.303 --> 00:07:44.545
I've got a beginner, intermediate,

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:45.045
and advanced.

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:45.985
So like the beginner one,

00:07:46.004 --> 00:07:46.826
maybe they would just talk

00:07:46.846 --> 00:07:47.846
to me and I'll fix it.

00:07:48.286 --> 00:07:49.105
I might view the screen.

00:07:49.127 --> 00:07:49.927
The advanced ones,

00:07:49.987 --> 00:07:51.026
I'll give them the actual

00:07:51.067 --> 00:07:53.208
AWS keys and say, here you go.

00:07:54.728 --> 00:07:55.528
Go ahead and fix it.

00:07:58.735 --> 00:08:00.538
available to all ages uh so

00:08:00.557 --> 00:08:01.778
I'm getting creative with

00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:03.459
it but yeah that was the

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.341
impetus of uh oh yeah so

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.341
friday I bought the domain

00:08:06.382 --> 00:08:08.923
cloudworkdance.com and then

00:08:09.024 --> 00:08:10.165
I set it up and sent out a

00:08:10.225 --> 00:08:11.786
mailing list to my measly

00:08:11.826 --> 00:08:12.706
hundred subscribers and I

00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:13.627
had the biggest reaction

00:08:13.648 --> 00:08:14.548
I've ever seen I've got

00:08:14.769 --> 00:08:15.750
people signing up coming

00:08:15.769 --> 00:08:16.470
out of the woodwork I have

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:18.331
no idea who they are and uh

00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:19.572
then I emailed you guys and

00:08:19.593 --> 00:08:20.273
then you guys were like you

00:08:20.293 --> 00:08:22.074
want to be on so here I am

00:08:22.115 --> 00:08:23.875
five days later and uh

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.201
Well, I'm glad it's going, you know,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.721
so quickly for you, you know,

00:08:29.762 --> 00:08:30.862
to have a hundred different

00:08:30.882 --> 00:08:31.802
scenarios that must have

00:08:31.822 --> 00:08:32.923
taken quite a long time.

00:08:32.942 --> 00:08:33.062
Like,

00:08:33.123 --> 00:08:34.222
I'm just thinking back throughout my

00:08:34.283 --> 00:08:34.763
career and like,

00:08:34.923 --> 00:08:35.462
I don't know if I could

00:08:35.503 --> 00:08:36.943
come up with like a hundred

00:08:36.984 --> 00:08:38.264
things that had gone wrong

00:08:38.403 --> 00:08:39.703
and have the whole scenario.

00:08:39.744 --> 00:08:40.565
I mean, for sure,

00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:41.345
more than a hundred things

00:08:41.365 --> 00:08:42.384
have gone wrong in my career.

00:08:42.684 --> 00:08:43.164
It's just, you know,

00:08:43.245 --> 00:08:44.326
having remembered them or

00:08:44.365 --> 00:08:45.346
have written them down,

00:08:45.365 --> 00:08:46.145
like that must have taken

00:08:46.285 --> 00:08:47.265
some effort on your part.

00:08:47.285 --> 00:08:49.307
I am a compulsive.

00:08:49.626 --> 00:08:49.966
I mean,

00:08:49.986 --> 00:08:51.548
I think I showed you guys in the preview.

00:08:51.567 --> 00:08:53.187
I am a compulsive note taker.

00:08:53.974 --> 00:08:55.495
and journaler and whatnot.

00:08:55.634 --> 00:08:56.917
I actually have multiple journals.

00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:58.037
I have a journal by the side of my bed,

00:08:58.057 --> 00:08:58.998
journal here, journal there.

00:08:59.018 --> 00:09:01.080
I've got business notebooks, I guess.

00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:03.162
So I piece it together.

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:06.604
And you know, if I'm not, I write it down.

00:09:06.663 --> 00:09:07.504
If there's another scenario,

00:09:07.524 --> 00:09:09.046
if something goes wrong,

00:09:09.105 --> 00:09:10.908
I also make a comic about it sometimes,

00:09:10.947 --> 00:09:13.409
so.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:13.990
Right, yeah,

00:09:14.009 --> 00:09:15.912
you shared some of your comics

00:09:15.971 --> 00:09:17.854
with us when we were

00:09:17.953 --> 00:09:19.315
emailing back and forth.

00:09:22.398 --> 00:09:23.879
Are those something you publish regularly?

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.080
I try and do them.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.341
I was doing them twice a week,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.061
but now that my content

00:09:29.081 --> 00:09:30.442
schedule's changed and I'm

00:09:30.461 --> 00:09:32.363
doing more video content publicly, again,

00:09:32.462 --> 00:09:33.864
I'm probably only going to do once a week,

00:09:33.903 --> 00:09:34.244
but we'll see.

00:09:34.283 --> 00:09:34.964
Right on.

00:09:36.745 --> 00:09:37.544
That's still a lot.

00:09:37.585 --> 00:09:39.225
That's, you know, fifty-two a year.

00:09:39.265 --> 00:09:40.966
That's still a lot of content.

00:09:41.586 --> 00:09:42.368
I'll be honest.

00:09:42.388 --> 00:09:43.327
They're not all bangers,

00:09:43.347 --> 00:09:44.448
but some of them take up.

00:10:02.697 --> 00:10:04.356
Do you find that through

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:05.097
through your I mean,

00:10:05.597 --> 00:10:07.077
having kept in journals of

00:10:07.158 --> 00:10:07.998
all of the different

00:10:08.158 --> 00:10:09.739
scenarios and what had happened,

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:11.379
what went wrong and how it was fixed,

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:13.259
like did that have a

00:10:13.299 --> 00:10:14.639
beneficial impact for your career?

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.559
Or do you just find that you

00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:18.461
are able to consume that

00:10:18.561 --> 00:10:20.321
information now to make the

00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:21.101
cloud war games?

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.121
I mean, I had thought,

00:10:24.182 --> 00:10:25.542
and this idea I had thought

00:10:25.562 --> 00:10:26.923
about coming back to for a long time.

00:10:26.962 --> 00:10:28.163
So I have been keeping them.

00:10:28.183 --> 00:10:29.083
And a lot of times now, I mean,

00:10:29.104 --> 00:10:30.144
I would just write a deal

00:10:30.184 --> 00:10:31.144
to my deal emailing list.

00:10:31.445 --> 00:10:32.105
If there's something that

00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:34.086
goes wrong or something I fear about,

00:10:34.147 --> 00:10:34.826
here's one that I want to

00:10:34.846 --> 00:10:36.187
really run a snare through

00:10:36.768 --> 00:10:37.788
is the S-III ransomware

00:10:37.807 --> 00:10:39.048
attack that's out there right now.

00:10:39.428 --> 00:10:41.169
I'm going to attack myself with that.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.909
That should be fun.

00:10:42.311 --> 00:10:42.870
But yeah,

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.111
I write it down and mail it out

00:10:45.251 --> 00:10:45.812
to people.

00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:46.312
So now, yeah,

00:10:46.332 --> 00:10:47.332
I guess collecting all that

00:10:47.352 --> 00:10:49.114
data has been helpful.

00:10:49.134 --> 00:10:50.815
I mean, in the last year, I've been better

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:52.357
I hired a business coach,

00:10:52.378 --> 00:10:54.078
and I've been better at

00:10:54.298 --> 00:10:55.780
sharing that information.

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:56.160
Before,

00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:57.562
I'd write it down just because I

00:10:58.042 --> 00:10:59.263
specifically take notes.

00:10:59.764 --> 00:11:00.264
And then now,

00:11:00.303 --> 00:11:01.065
it's like I'm actually

00:11:01.904 --> 00:11:02.926
finding and helping other

00:11:02.966 --> 00:11:05.528
people get updates on Amazon,

00:11:05.548 --> 00:11:07.909
get updates on things I'm

00:11:07.929 --> 00:11:09.610
an expert in that I enjoy doing.

00:11:09.692 --> 00:11:10.511
So yes,

00:11:10.572 --> 00:11:11.913
I think it's got a beneficial impact,

00:11:11.932 --> 00:11:13.434
but I didn't really

00:11:13.495 --> 00:11:15.176
capitalize on that until fairly recently.

00:11:15.888 --> 00:11:16.369
Yeah, I mean,

00:11:16.749 --> 00:11:17.570
the fact you just mentioned

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:18.671
this like I can't believe I

00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:20.052
haven't been keeping track

00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:21.974
of every single bug that

00:11:21.994 --> 00:11:23.294
I've run into that has some sort of,

00:11:23.774 --> 00:11:26.457
you know, out as it turns out, you know,

00:11:26.557 --> 00:11:28.159
and then a story because I

00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:28.840
feel like there is some

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.020
novel interesting thing

00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:32.043
there that is worth sharing and.

00:11:33.004 --> 00:11:33.985
Now I'm starting to think,

00:11:34.605 --> 00:11:36.025
would I give this advice to

00:11:36.546 --> 00:11:38.267
even experienced senior engineers?

00:11:38.606 --> 00:11:39.187
Oh, you know what?

00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:40.707
Start keeping a personal

00:11:40.748 --> 00:11:42.448
journal of these sorts of things.

00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:44.070
I usually talk about it in a

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.870
business context.

00:11:44.909 --> 00:11:45.831
It's great to keep track of

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.471
what you're doing from a

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.652
brag standpoint so that you

00:11:48.692 --> 00:11:50.072
can report on it during

00:11:50.393 --> 00:11:52.394
your hopefully quarterly

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:53.774
performance evaluation.

00:11:53.934 --> 00:11:55.134
You have a list already of

00:11:55.195 --> 00:11:55.916
everything you've done.

00:11:56.676 --> 00:11:57.596
and I think there's a lot to

00:11:57.657 --> 00:11:58.456
be said there but I think

00:11:58.476 --> 00:11:59.418
there's another level here

00:11:59.498 --> 00:12:00.898
of like the interesting

00:12:00.957 --> 00:12:02.119
technical challenges that

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:03.679
you had to face and how you

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.860
sort of tackled them

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.900
because like you've already

00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:07.562
found a new opportunity

00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:09.222
based off of what you've

00:12:09.302 --> 00:12:10.943
written down to you know

00:12:10.964 --> 00:12:13.264
turn into a business yeah I

00:12:13.304 --> 00:12:14.485
mean it's a good habit to

00:12:14.546 --> 00:12:15.726
do after action reports

00:12:15.746 --> 00:12:16.407
especially when you're

00:12:16.427 --> 00:12:17.106
training a junior or

00:12:17.167 --> 00:12:18.368
something like that you

00:12:18.388 --> 00:12:19.328
know they make a mistake

00:12:19.469 --> 00:12:20.528
you know a fairly expensive

00:12:20.568 --> 00:12:22.110
mistake maybe you know they

00:12:22.129 --> 00:12:23.811
delete something they shouldn't and then

00:12:30.246 --> 00:12:31.927
We just, you know,

00:12:31.988 --> 00:12:32.967
let's say I got a client, you know,

00:12:32.988 --> 00:12:33.788
their website goes down,

00:12:33.808 --> 00:12:34.688
let's say it costs them a

00:12:34.749 --> 00:12:36.110
hundred thousand dollars an hour.

00:12:36.129 --> 00:12:37.009
Junior takes down that

00:12:37.071 --> 00:12:38.331
website for a while.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.511
They can look at it like, oh my God,

00:12:39.532 --> 00:12:40.292
we lost all this money.

00:12:40.312 --> 00:12:41.273
Or you just say, oh,

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:43.293
we invested this much into

00:12:43.413 --> 00:12:44.774
our junior learning important lesson.

00:12:45.195 --> 00:12:46.575
Let's have them present that

00:12:46.995 --> 00:12:48.176
in an after action report

00:12:48.196 --> 00:12:49.037
to the whole team.

00:12:49.076 --> 00:12:49.756
So we got, you know,

00:12:49.777 --> 00:12:50.658
there's a positive from it.

00:12:51.097 --> 00:12:51.418
Here's,

00:12:51.597 --> 00:12:53.438
you're writing the SOPs for the business,

00:12:53.658 --> 00:12:54.298
standard operating

00:12:54.318 --> 00:12:55.100
procedures for the business.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.360
I don't know what not to do, you know?

00:12:57.789 --> 00:12:59.070
That's something I try and

00:12:59.289 --> 00:13:01.010
push towards my developers.

00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:02.951
Fail forward faster.

00:13:02.971 --> 00:13:04.052
Know where to fail at,

00:13:04.091 --> 00:13:05.993
where you can make mistakes at.

00:13:06.033 --> 00:13:07.493
Fail on staging.

00:13:07.513 --> 00:13:08.293
Nuke staging out of the

00:13:08.312 --> 00:13:10.094
water and slow down our dev

00:13:10.293 --> 00:13:12.975
team for a day still costs

00:13:13.034 --> 00:13:14.075
us less than if you nuked

00:13:14.134 --> 00:13:15.676
production for even a few minutes.

00:13:16.716 --> 00:13:18.476
Learn where to fail, learn how to fail.

00:13:18.716 --> 00:13:21.418
This is one of those rants

00:13:21.498 --> 00:13:22.197
you get worried about.

00:13:26.311 --> 00:13:27.331
I want to come back to something.

00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:28.331
There's been a couple of

00:13:28.352 --> 00:13:29.592
things you've said that

00:13:29.692 --> 00:13:30.754
have stood out to me,

00:13:30.774 --> 00:13:31.934
and I want to come back to those,

00:13:32.075 --> 00:13:33.336
even though they have

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:36.639
nothing to do with cloudwargames.com.

00:13:36.658 --> 00:13:38.279
You mentioned that you're in

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.561
a mastermind and then you

00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:42.022
also talked about your journaling.

00:13:42.042 --> 00:13:42.942
And those are two of like

00:13:43.102 --> 00:13:45.565
the consistent things that

00:13:45.585 --> 00:13:48.206
like if you study like high impact,

00:13:48.246 --> 00:13:49.368
high performing people like

00:13:49.447 --> 00:13:50.347
those two things.

00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:53.471
come up over and over again.

00:13:53.551 --> 00:13:55.192
So how did you get into a

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:56.192
mastermind and what does

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:56.952
that look like for you?

00:13:58.153 --> 00:14:02.895
Uh, I'm actually in several, um, and, uh,

00:14:02.916 --> 00:14:03.836
we can do a whole other

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:05.498
podcast on the consulting side of things,

00:14:05.538 --> 00:14:06.458
instruction, your business,

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:07.980
which I'm going to save for another time.

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:11.981
But, uh, there, there's one where I am, uh,

00:14:12.001 --> 00:14:13.523
a group coaching, uh, where,

00:14:13.582 --> 00:14:14.823
where they do live Q and

00:14:14.844 --> 00:14:17.785
A's and stuff like that aimed at solo, um,

00:14:17.806 --> 00:14:19.086
consultants, expertise,

00:14:19.246 --> 00:14:19.787
people who want to,

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.451
with themselves as experts.

00:14:21.471 --> 00:14:22.851
I would never call myself the expert,

00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:26.313
but I've been doing this a long time.

00:14:26.715 --> 00:14:27.975
So that's a good one.

00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:30.177
I have direct access to the

00:14:30.496 --> 00:14:31.317
main community guy there.

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:32.118
And the other one is the

00:14:32.138 --> 00:14:34.460
Room Around Robin approach,

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.841
where I found that one, I think,

00:14:36.902 --> 00:14:37.682
through another community,

00:14:37.701 --> 00:14:38.623
actually a third community,

00:14:38.643 --> 00:14:39.683
where it's actually got

00:14:39.703 --> 00:14:40.804
very limited interaction,

00:14:40.845 --> 00:14:42.566
but they do things.

00:14:42.586 --> 00:14:43.846
And I can give you guys the

00:14:43.866 --> 00:14:44.687
name to some of this stuff

00:14:44.706 --> 00:14:45.368
if you want later,

00:14:45.408 --> 00:14:48.269
but I'm actually starting to know

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:49.778
I'm hoping to start another

00:14:49.798 --> 00:14:50.519
mastermind group,

00:14:50.538 --> 00:14:52.639
but I've kind of deprioritized that for,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.821
uh, CTU for, um, Cloud of Oregon.

00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:57.860
See, now I don't even remember the name.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.541
Um, because that's,

00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:01.782
that's got way a lot of

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:02.621
traction right now,

00:15:02.682 --> 00:15:04.741
but I would strongly advise that,

00:15:04.782 --> 00:15:05.802
especially if you're, you're,

00:15:05.842 --> 00:15:06.763
you're going out there and

00:15:06.783 --> 00:15:07.442
starting on your own and

00:15:07.462 --> 00:15:08.863
you're not part of the big team.

00:15:08.883 --> 00:15:09.123
If you're,

00:15:09.143 --> 00:15:10.464
if you're starting your own consulting,

00:15:10.864 --> 00:15:12.504
you need that sounding board.

00:15:12.803 --> 00:15:14.543
I'm very fortunate to have a

00:15:15.264 --> 00:15:16.365
informal business partner

00:15:16.384 --> 00:15:17.485
that we have just, we are,

00:15:18.014 --> 00:15:19.515
always bouncing ideas off each other.

00:15:19.535 --> 00:15:20.916
Cause it can be, you know,

00:15:20.936 --> 00:15:21.775
in a vacuum when you're

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:22.897
trying to get clients, it can be,

00:15:22.937 --> 00:15:24.918
you know, seem very daunting,

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:26.317
seem very dark.

00:15:26.918 --> 00:15:27.658
Yeah, for sure.

00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:27.999
I've,

00:15:28.458 --> 00:15:30.360
I belong to a mastermind that I've

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:34.421
been in for well over ten years now.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.581
And it's, it's been,

00:15:39.066 --> 00:15:40.746
it's been the difference in

00:15:40.787 --> 00:15:41.907
my career because like our

00:15:41.986 --> 00:15:43.866
sole purpose in that group

00:15:44.307 --> 00:15:46.028
is to call each other out

00:15:46.107 --> 00:15:47.107
on our bullshit and hold

00:15:47.148 --> 00:15:48.129
each other accountable.

00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:50.708
And it's made a difference.

00:15:50.808 --> 00:15:50.909
Yeah.

00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:51.409
We actually,

00:15:51.549 --> 00:15:52.929
we actually did a full episode

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.350
dedicated to, uh,

00:15:54.451 --> 00:15:56.530
Will's being called out on his bullshit.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.351
I mean, cause there's a lot of it.

00:15:58.471 --> 00:16:00.211
Like those, the guys in my mastermind,

00:16:00.231 --> 00:16:01.393
they have a full-time job

00:16:01.432 --> 00:16:02.552
calling me out on my bullshit.

00:16:02.572 --> 00:16:02.653
Yeah.

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:02.952
Uh,

00:16:06.677 --> 00:16:08.099
My most valuable people are

00:16:08.119 --> 00:16:09.580
the people that are the bluntest with me.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.621
They're willing to be like,

00:16:12.042 --> 00:16:13.903
stop building developer tools, you fool.

00:16:14.644 --> 00:16:16.284
Right?

00:16:16.365 --> 00:16:17.605
And giving them away for free.

00:16:17.725 --> 00:16:20.408
I think that's the important caveat there.

00:16:21.168 --> 00:16:22.610
Yeah.

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:23.090
For sure.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.091
And then on journaling,

00:16:25.532 --> 00:16:27.212
is that a daily exercise for you?

00:16:28.014 --> 00:16:28.094
Yep.

00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:29.774
Let the dogs out,

00:16:29.914 --> 00:16:31.176
and then it's pretty much

00:16:31.216 --> 00:16:32.197
straight to journaling.

00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:33.538
And then I've recently been

00:16:33.577 --> 00:16:34.379
trying to do more

00:16:34.418 --> 00:16:36.200
journaling in the evening, actually.

00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:38.168
to close the thought loop.

00:16:38.187 --> 00:16:39.908
I have a lot of trouble sleeping,

00:16:40.068 --> 00:16:41.570
and I wake up in the middle of the night,

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:42.649
and I'm like, oh,

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:43.610
all these things I should do,

00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:44.871
so right before I go to bed,

00:16:45.032 --> 00:16:46.211
I try and write down

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.553
anything that's open-ended

00:16:48.573 --> 00:16:49.933
here on a piece of paper,

00:16:49.953 --> 00:16:51.575
and I've got sticky notes

00:16:51.615 --> 00:16:52.975
on the side of the bed that I'll write,

00:16:53.035 --> 00:16:53.836
oh, to-do, to-do, to-do,

00:16:53.875 --> 00:16:55.057
and that way I could be like, okay,

00:16:55.657 --> 00:16:56.658
tomorrow, Matt, we'll get to this,

00:17:03.193 --> 00:17:03.413
Yeah,

00:17:03.433 --> 00:17:04.555
I think there were a non-trivial

00:17:04.575 --> 00:17:05.977
number of times where in

00:17:06.017 --> 00:17:06.998
order to sleep well at night,

00:17:07.057 --> 00:17:08.699
I had to write up a whole

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.382
email regarding a situation

00:17:11.501 --> 00:17:12.843
and then just not send it.

00:17:13.183 --> 00:17:16.666
Not send it that night.

00:17:16.686 --> 00:17:18.489
That's the important factor there.

00:17:18.528 --> 00:17:19.028
Yeah, for sure.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.790
When you're frustrated,

00:17:21.871 --> 00:17:22.892
definitely don't click send.

00:17:23.731 --> 00:17:24.211
But, you know,

00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:25.232
it's because those thoughts

00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:26.153
are going around in your head,

00:17:26.173 --> 00:17:27.153
and it's like I'm

00:17:27.193 --> 00:17:29.555
constantly focused on whatever that is,

00:17:29.595 --> 00:17:30.575
whatever problem it is,

00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:32.135
whether or not I did the

00:17:32.175 --> 00:17:33.376
right thing in that situation,

00:17:33.477 --> 00:17:34.817
and sometimes just, I mean,

00:17:34.897 --> 00:17:35.998
I know from a fact now,

00:17:36.157 --> 00:17:37.618
I have to terminate those threads,

00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:38.558
whatever the thread is that

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:39.940
I picked up and I started

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.260
just getting it done,

00:17:41.441 --> 00:17:42.761
whether it's writing an email.

00:17:43.142 --> 00:17:43.602
I use, like,

00:17:43.701 --> 00:17:45.462
every single kind of scheduling tool

00:17:45.663 --> 00:17:46.383
tool available.

00:17:46.403 --> 00:17:48.223
Like I will delay emails to myself.

00:17:48.384 --> 00:17:49.484
I will snooze them.

00:17:49.605 --> 00:17:51.025
I will send myself future emails.

00:17:51.345 --> 00:17:52.425
I'll use calendar events,

00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:55.106
anything to get stuff off

00:17:55.146 --> 00:17:56.807
of my radar and into some

00:17:56.847 --> 00:17:58.728
sort of temporal delay so

00:17:58.768 --> 00:17:59.548
that I can come back to it

00:17:59.608 --> 00:18:01.549
later when I'm like at the right time.

00:18:01.569 --> 00:18:04.631
Yeah, that's a big one.

00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:05.131
You talk about, you know,

00:18:05.151 --> 00:18:05.891
you're frustrated and you

00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:06.392
write that email.

00:18:06.412 --> 00:18:07.711
When I get frustrated with

00:18:07.731 --> 00:18:09.153
something or possibly even

00:18:09.173 --> 00:18:10.272
a colleague or something like that,

00:18:10.292 --> 00:18:11.594
I write it on a sticky note

00:18:11.713 --> 00:18:12.834
and a month later it's a comic.

00:18:12.874 --> 00:18:14.154
So I just, you know, that's how I do.

00:18:16.017 --> 00:18:16.798
I don't send it to them

00:18:16.837 --> 00:18:17.857
necessarily unless it's, you know, funny.

00:18:17.877 --> 00:18:18.939
Yeah.

00:18:19.219 --> 00:18:22.361
No, that's great.

00:18:22.382 --> 00:18:22.862
Right on.

00:18:23.382 --> 00:18:25.723
So we'll come back to Cloud War Games.

00:18:27.605 --> 00:18:29.465
You've got people signing up for it.

00:18:29.645 --> 00:18:30.267
Is it like,

00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:32.228
are you operating like

00:18:32.468 --> 00:18:33.729
scheduled head-to-head

00:18:33.769 --> 00:18:35.529
matches or is it a single

00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:36.510
player experience?

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:37.751
What's the interface look like?

00:18:39.063 --> 00:18:40.344
I like to do it with small teams.

00:18:40.923 --> 00:18:42.724
So I'm thinking right now

00:18:42.744 --> 00:18:44.484
we've got four people in the hot seat.

00:18:44.525 --> 00:18:45.306
We're going to experiment

00:18:45.326 --> 00:18:46.246
with our initial batch.

00:18:46.266 --> 00:18:47.826
So that means I've got two events.

00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:49.647
Four people could be on camera.

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:50.807
Mike's hot.

00:18:50.928 --> 00:18:52.229
And hopefully anybody else

00:18:52.249 --> 00:18:52.969
that wants to be in the

00:18:52.989 --> 00:18:54.450
wait list or whatever, the gallery,

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:56.069
they can chat quietly.

00:18:57.111 --> 00:18:57.611
But like I said,

00:18:57.631 --> 00:19:01.291
I'm going to do three tiers of it.

00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:02.452
And in the future,

00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:03.854
I might do four people sign

00:19:03.874 --> 00:19:04.473
up for big dinner,

00:19:04.534 --> 00:19:05.693
four people sign up for intermediate,

00:19:05.733 --> 00:19:06.555
four people sign up for

00:19:06.575 --> 00:19:07.234
advanced or something.

00:19:07.829 --> 00:19:08.230
but the,

00:19:08.269 --> 00:19:09.569
you can kind of just hang around

00:19:09.609 --> 00:19:11.030
if you did the beginner one

00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:11.851
and you can listen to the

00:19:11.871 --> 00:19:12.971
intermediate and the advanced,

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.451
but I don't want the

00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:14.631
advanced people solving the

00:19:14.651 --> 00:19:16.171
intermediate one instantly there.

00:19:16.731 --> 00:19:19.392
And so the way I do it is

00:19:19.511 --> 00:19:21.332
there'll be a pre kind of,

00:19:21.672 --> 00:19:23.673
let's just say it's an hour long session.

00:19:23.772 --> 00:19:25.333
First, fifteen minutes, you get in there,

00:19:25.353 --> 00:19:26.153
you get your bearings.

00:19:26.173 --> 00:19:26.512
You can,

00:19:26.972 --> 00:19:28.773
I'll send out network diagrams

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:29.874
using my pixel art network

00:19:29.894 --> 00:19:31.273
diagram software that I use

00:19:31.314 --> 00:19:32.354
for my YouTube videos.

00:19:33.034 --> 00:19:34.114
And I had a time and I'll

00:19:34.134 --> 00:19:35.315
set up a terraform ahead of time.

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:36.855
So then people can get a feel for that.

00:19:38.054 --> 00:19:38.713
Um, we get in there,

00:19:38.753 --> 00:19:40.194
maybe you set up your dashboard, you know,

00:19:40.214 --> 00:19:40.714
you figure out your

00:19:40.755 --> 00:19:41.855
firefighting tools for the

00:19:41.894 --> 00:19:42.654
first few minutes.

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:45.736
And then I do the brief and I say,

00:19:46.056 --> 00:19:48.056
customer service just called and said,

00:19:48.076 --> 00:19:50.817
you know, that we, we just sent out,

00:19:51.096 --> 00:19:51.596
this is actually,

00:19:51.616 --> 00:19:52.817
this is probably my first one.

00:19:52.916 --> 00:19:54.518
So preview for those of you guys,

00:19:54.538 --> 00:19:55.577
I don't know when this is coming out,

00:19:55.597 --> 00:19:57.057
but preview for the first advanced one,

00:19:57.657 --> 00:19:59.798
uh, customer service shows up and says,

00:19:59.838 --> 00:20:01.638
we just sent out a lot of

00:20:01.719 --> 00:20:03.240
emails from our primary

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:04.400
email address that people get.

00:20:05.165 --> 00:20:06.425
and it's for a

00:20:06.445 --> 00:20:08.146
pharmaceutical ad of some nature.

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:09.646
It's like that.

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:10.446
And we don't do that.

00:20:10.487 --> 00:20:11.387
So what just happened?

00:20:12.028 --> 00:20:13.768
So, and that happened to me,

00:20:13.948 --> 00:20:14.828
that did happen to me.

00:20:14.888 --> 00:20:15.828
And it also was a conflict.

00:20:16.888 --> 00:20:18.589
So, you know, and then after that,

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:19.769
let's just say,

00:20:19.809 --> 00:20:21.410
fifteen minutes to a half

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:22.770
an hour diagnosing.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.151
So you got to do diagnosis first.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.611
And then from there,

00:20:25.631 --> 00:20:26.932
they got to come up with a solution.

00:20:27.152 --> 00:20:28.872
And I'm going to give read

00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:30.553
access to my AWS account to

00:20:30.633 --> 00:20:31.373
anybody on there.

00:20:32.563 --> 00:20:33.863
I'm not going to give you right access.

00:20:33.883 --> 00:20:35.263
So you get to tell me the solution.

00:20:35.463 --> 00:20:36.683
I'm not never giving anybody

00:20:36.703 --> 00:20:37.744
else right access to that.

00:20:38.505 --> 00:20:39.325
And then from there,

00:20:39.724 --> 00:20:41.645
last fifteen minutes after action report,

00:20:41.965 --> 00:20:42.266
you know,

00:20:42.286 --> 00:20:42.925
I kind of give them a peek

00:20:42.965 --> 00:20:43.507
behind the scene.

00:20:43.547 --> 00:20:46.207
What did I do and how could

00:20:46.227 --> 00:20:48.067
you have improved the speed

00:20:48.107 --> 00:20:49.769
at which you diagnose the situation?

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:50.249
So.

00:20:50.548 --> 00:20:51.989
Oh, that's cool.

00:20:52.249 --> 00:20:52.650
That's cool.

00:20:56.556 --> 00:20:57.817
Are you recording these for

00:21:00.239 --> 00:21:01.119
creating a YouTube channel

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.601
where people can watch it after the fact?

00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:03.801
Yes.

00:21:03.882 --> 00:21:04.102
I mean,

00:21:04.201 --> 00:21:06.364
one thing I thought about is that

00:21:06.483 --> 00:21:07.265
part of the need for this

00:21:07.305 --> 00:21:08.286
thing is that there are so

00:21:08.326 --> 00:21:10.528
many AI-generated resumes out there.

00:21:10.587 --> 00:21:13.109
It's tough for people, software engineers,

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:13.809
DevOps people,

00:21:13.829 --> 00:21:15.692
to stand out in that stack of resumes.

00:21:16.152 --> 00:21:17.874
Also, so many people are using AI to code.

00:21:17.913 --> 00:21:19.295
And I'm not against that,

00:21:19.414 --> 00:21:21.136
but the standard coding

00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:22.176
tests don't work so well.

00:21:22.238 --> 00:21:24.019
So this, I want them to record.

00:21:24.662 --> 00:21:26.002
And I want them to share that,

00:21:26.042 --> 00:21:26.923
be able to share this with

00:21:26.962 --> 00:21:29.664
perspective hiring people.

00:21:29.785 --> 00:21:30.726
You know, on the other side of this,

00:21:30.826 --> 00:21:31.925
if you're hiring people,

00:21:32.287 --> 00:21:32.987
how do you know that

00:21:33.007 --> 00:21:34.667
they're actually able to problem solve?

00:21:34.688 --> 00:21:35.388
Don't you want to kind of

00:21:35.409 --> 00:21:35.989
get a feel for it?

00:21:36.009 --> 00:21:36.669
Don't you want to see if

00:21:36.689 --> 00:21:37.710
they are collaborative in

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.770
nature or are they more like,

00:21:39.211 --> 00:21:40.050
I'm going to just go heads

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.092
down and not tell anybody

00:21:41.112 --> 00:21:41.612
what I'm thinking.

00:21:41.632 --> 00:21:43.794
You know, you want to get a feel for that.

00:21:43.834 --> 00:21:45.193
Maybe there's, you know,

00:21:45.674 --> 00:21:46.454
you want one or the other,

00:21:46.474 --> 00:21:47.596
but this could be a really

00:21:47.635 --> 00:21:48.916
powerful hiring tool, I think.

00:21:48.936 --> 00:21:50.557
Oh yeah, for sure.

00:21:50.837 --> 00:21:51.057
Yeah.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.490
Yeah.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:54.171
Cause then you get like a

00:21:54.211 --> 00:21:55.652
little insight into what this,

00:21:55.791 --> 00:21:58.051
what it's like to work with

00:21:58.071 --> 00:21:59.593
this person under pressure,

00:21:59.633 --> 00:22:01.032
which is everything that

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:02.573
you want to know before hiring a person,

00:22:02.593 --> 00:22:03.753
but have no way to test it.

00:22:03.773 --> 00:22:04.693
Yeah.

00:22:04.773 --> 00:22:06.193
And then the flip side,

00:22:06.233 --> 00:22:06.854
it's a great way to

00:22:06.894 --> 00:22:08.214
inoculate yourself to stress.

00:22:08.255 --> 00:22:11.275
I see so many developers and the, you know,

00:22:11.295 --> 00:22:12.736
the CEO comes running in and saying,

00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:14.855
we're losing money, we're losing money.

00:22:15.215 --> 00:22:16.277
And they're screaming and everything.

00:22:16.297 --> 00:22:17.237
And they're just like, Oh yeah,

00:22:17.257 --> 00:22:18.317
they lock up, you know,

00:22:18.336 --> 00:22:20.218
and this inoculates you from the stress.

00:22:21.057 --> 00:22:21.617
We talk about,

00:22:24.428 --> 00:22:25.449
dealing with this type of stress.

00:22:25.509 --> 00:22:27.832
Because in my gymnastics career,

00:22:27.852 --> 00:22:28.692
if you're spotting somebody

00:22:28.712 --> 00:22:29.273
and you mess up,

00:22:29.755 --> 00:22:30.635
you could significantly

00:22:30.715 --> 00:22:32.178
injure or harm an athlete.

00:22:32.739 --> 00:22:33.480
You know, this,

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.461
some rich guy loses a bunch of money,

00:22:35.481 --> 00:22:36.363
but no one dies.

00:22:36.784 --> 00:22:38.085
And so if you put that in that perspective,

00:22:38.105 --> 00:22:38.826
it makes it easier to

00:22:38.865 --> 00:22:40.107
handle this stressful situation.

00:22:43.259 --> 00:22:44.121
I mean, for sure,

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:44.840
there's not a lot of

00:22:44.901 --> 00:22:45.942
opportunity to practice

00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:48.624
emergency situations in the tech.

00:22:48.644 --> 00:22:48.884
Right.

00:22:49.204 --> 00:22:50.425
And so the only time we're

00:22:50.445 --> 00:22:51.385
in that situation is when

00:22:51.425 --> 00:22:52.826
we really mess up.

00:22:52.846 --> 00:22:53.028
I mean,

00:22:53.048 --> 00:22:54.709
some companies do like there is

00:22:54.729 --> 00:22:56.750
this idea in the industry, oh, you should,

00:22:57.171 --> 00:22:58.511
you know, practice your run books,

00:22:58.531 --> 00:23:00.353
you know, databases being down,

00:23:00.953 --> 00:23:02.255
regional failures, et cetera.

00:23:02.295 --> 00:23:04.957
But I think that a majority of companies,

00:23:05.017 --> 00:23:06.116
the ones who need to

00:23:06.157 --> 00:23:07.057
practice at the most

00:23:07.377 --> 00:23:08.719
because they are in too

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:10.019
much in firefighting modes

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.000
are exactly the ones who

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.741
don't practice it.

00:23:12.501 --> 00:23:13.722
Yeah.

00:23:13.742 --> 00:23:14.462
So I mean,

00:23:14.843 --> 00:23:15.903
this this could be more than

00:23:15.943 --> 00:23:17.084
just a hiring tool.

00:23:17.203 --> 00:23:17.723
Realistically,

00:23:17.763 --> 00:23:19.825
this could be like out of

00:23:19.884 --> 00:23:22.326
band practice for engineers

00:23:22.346 --> 00:23:23.686
at any company to sign up and be like,

00:23:23.747 --> 00:23:25.406
hey, you know, go through this equivalent,

00:23:25.728 --> 00:23:26.847
you know, live training, right?

00:23:26.867 --> 00:23:28.489
Continue education on how to

00:23:28.528 --> 00:23:29.209
do these things.

00:23:29.788 --> 00:23:30.648
You know how you're going to

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.650
respond in that situation

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.809
and then potentially be

00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:34.070
graded or get opportunity

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.551
like feedback on how they can improve.

00:23:36.632 --> 00:23:39.553
Yeah, I mean,

00:23:39.573 --> 00:23:40.252
I could see myself being

00:23:40.272 --> 00:23:41.733
bringing this into a large company.

00:23:42.344 --> 00:23:43.744
and then looking at their

00:23:43.765 --> 00:23:44.885
infrastructure setting up a

00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:45.686
drill similar to their

00:23:45.707 --> 00:23:46.708
infrastructure and knocking

00:23:46.728 --> 00:23:48.189
it over and doing trainings

00:23:48.229 --> 00:23:49.230
internally I mean there's

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.230
there's all sorts of

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.832
options I mean back to the

00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:53.272
kind of individual side I'd

00:23:53.313 --> 00:23:54.334
love to have a leaderboard

00:23:54.634 --> 00:23:55.875
and championships

00:23:55.915 --> 00:23:57.596
eventually I've got ideas

00:23:57.636 --> 00:23:58.637
for all sorts of fun stuff

00:23:58.678 --> 00:24:00.398
to do but yeah there's I

00:24:00.419 --> 00:24:01.279
think there's a lot that

00:24:01.299 --> 00:24:04.202
can be done with this could

00:24:04.242 --> 00:24:06.785
be like the next next iteration of um

00:24:08.048 --> 00:24:08.890
like e-gaming,

00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:10.671
like the professional gamers.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:12.071
Yeah.

00:24:12.132 --> 00:24:14.492
You're actually not, not just,

00:24:14.512 --> 00:24:16.433
I am a gamer obviously, but you know,

00:24:16.453 --> 00:24:17.934
a little more productive than just,

00:24:17.954 --> 00:24:18.556
you know, Fortnite.

00:24:18.576 --> 00:24:21.597
Yeah.

00:24:23.479 --> 00:24:24.539
So I think I saw, Will,

00:24:24.599 --> 00:24:25.579
you were into CrossFit.

00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:29.423
I can see the CrossFit games for, you know,

00:24:29.442 --> 00:24:31.084
ops people, for infrastructure people.

00:24:31.644 --> 00:24:32.384
Oh yeah, for sure.

00:24:35.034 --> 00:24:36.134
I'm sure no one ever heard

00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:36.954
me say this before,

00:24:36.994 --> 00:24:38.096
but what I've done with work,

00:24:38.115 --> 00:24:39.037
what I want to do is go

00:24:39.096 --> 00:24:41.598
home and play another game.

00:24:41.638 --> 00:24:42.579
Play a game that's exactly

00:24:42.599 --> 00:24:46.182
the same as what I do for work every day.

00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:48.084
With higher stakes, potentially,

00:24:48.124 --> 00:24:49.305
than what I'm doing at work.

00:24:49.345 --> 00:24:51.886
Yeah.

00:24:51.987 --> 00:24:55.009
I'm hoping people do that.

00:24:55.048 --> 00:24:55.548
So far,

00:24:55.568 --> 00:24:57.151
it seems like people are interested.

00:24:57.851 --> 00:24:58.471
Yeah.

00:24:58.971 --> 00:25:02.074
I think it's exciting.

00:25:02.134 --> 00:25:02.835
I think it's like...

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:04.461
Well,

00:25:04.721 --> 00:25:06.262
I'm going to make that a little

00:25:06.462 --> 00:25:07.262
stronger statement.

00:25:07.303 --> 00:25:09.045
I know that there are a lot

00:25:09.085 --> 00:25:12.508
of people who are early in their career,

00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:13.788
and DevOps is one of those

00:25:13.888 --> 00:25:15.390
industries that it's so

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.871
hard to get into because

00:25:16.891 --> 00:25:19.252
you can't get into DevOps

00:25:19.633 --> 00:25:21.454
without having DevOps experience,

00:25:21.474 --> 00:25:22.516
and you can't get DevOps

00:25:22.536 --> 00:25:25.438
experience without working in DevOps.

00:25:25.478 --> 00:25:27.519
And this actually gives you

00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:31.063
a way to solve that problem.

00:25:31.202 --> 00:25:32.743
That is Thursday's comic, by the way.

00:25:33.625 --> 00:25:34.767
You have to have five years

00:25:34.787 --> 00:25:35.748
of experience for this

00:25:35.827 --> 00:25:37.209
entry-level job or whatever.

00:25:37.229 --> 00:25:39.751
How do you have chicken and egg?

00:25:40.127 --> 00:25:42.869
This might solve that problem, though,

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:43.109
you know?

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.049
Yeah, I mean,

00:25:44.069 --> 00:25:45.872
I think it's sort of the same thing,

00:25:45.932 --> 00:25:46.211
though,

00:25:46.352 --> 00:25:47.932
where people don't leave the

00:25:47.992 --> 00:25:50.074
university and go directly

00:25:50.134 --> 00:25:51.994
into the executive role,

00:25:52.215 --> 00:25:53.696
where realistically part,

00:25:53.836 --> 00:25:54.537
I think one of the most

00:25:54.557 --> 00:25:55.978
important aspects of DevOps

00:25:56.018 --> 00:25:56.898
is sort of understanding

00:25:56.939 --> 00:25:58.038
the connection of the

00:25:58.078 --> 00:25:59.759
business and what you're

00:25:59.779 --> 00:26:00.780
trying to execute and

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.842
running it and how that

00:26:02.882 --> 00:26:04.343
impacts the technology and

00:26:04.383 --> 00:26:05.523
what it actually means for

00:26:05.624 --> 00:26:08.086
uptime and providing that as a

00:26:08.885 --> 00:26:10.406
value add to whoever your

00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:11.627
users or customers are.

00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:13.930
And I think one of the huge

00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:15.290
challenges there is that's

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.551
just not really something

00:26:16.571 --> 00:26:18.594
you're taught in any level

00:26:18.773 --> 00:26:20.055
of education system.

00:26:20.855 --> 00:26:23.097
You don't go to your

00:26:23.698 --> 00:26:24.739
chemistry class or your

00:26:24.798 --> 00:26:27.500
physics or calculus and be

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.022
taught about how that

00:26:29.063 --> 00:26:30.923
provides value to end users

00:26:30.963 --> 00:26:32.806
somewhere and how critical that is.

00:26:33.046 --> 00:26:34.567
I mean, because if you were,

00:26:34.606 --> 00:26:35.406
then you could sort of

00:26:35.507 --> 00:26:36.507
maybe make the jump there.

00:26:36.547 --> 00:26:37.366
But I feel like that's one

00:26:37.386 --> 00:26:38.288
of the biggest things,

00:26:38.548 --> 00:26:39.327
the lack of experience,

00:26:39.347 --> 00:26:40.788
but also the lack of

00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:42.848
attention to how to utilize

00:26:42.888 --> 00:26:45.250
those skills in a real-world environment.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.290
And I think the email sent

00:26:47.471 --> 00:26:48.371
out that has a business

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.571
impact starts to scratch that.

00:26:51.612 --> 00:26:52.673
It's not just that there is

00:26:52.732 --> 00:26:54.012
an emergency situation.

00:26:54.373 --> 00:26:55.373
It could just be about a

00:26:55.394 --> 00:26:56.394
debugging experience,

00:26:56.453 --> 00:26:57.453
like how did this happen?

00:26:57.753 --> 00:26:58.634
But understanding that there

00:26:58.674 --> 00:26:59.654
is a real impact

00:26:59.994 --> 00:27:01.717
to real customers somewhere

00:27:01.836 --> 00:27:02.817
that someone will care and

00:27:02.857 --> 00:27:03.618
money is getting lost.

00:27:03.659 --> 00:27:04.640
I think that's the sort of

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:05.359
thing that a lot of people

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.842
are insulated throughout

00:27:06.902 --> 00:27:09.403
their academic career.

00:27:09.523 --> 00:27:09.844
Yeah,

00:27:11.445 --> 00:27:12.686
that's the I see engineers making a

00:27:12.707 --> 00:27:13.788
lot of decisions based on

00:27:13.887 --> 00:27:15.670
ones and zeros and not dollars and cents.

00:27:20.074 --> 00:27:20.714
I like that tagline, right?

00:27:20.755 --> 00:27:21.335
I see it happening.

00:27:21.355 --> 00:27:22.476
And as a business owner, I

00:27:23.847 --> 00:27:25.469
I have to take into account

00:27:25.528 --> 00:27:26.409
the bottom line.

00:27:26.429 --> 00:27:26.869
Recently,

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.789
I had a major outage for one of

00:27:28.809 --> 00:27:30.351
my clients right before the

00:27:30.391 --> 00:27:33.432
holiday season, and we had a triage.

00:27:33.553 --> 00:27:35.133
We actually had to decide to

00:27:35.173 --> 00:27:36.334
have a bunch of different domains.

00:27:37.354 --> 00:27:38.434
It's not Coke or Pepsi or anything,

00:27:38.454 --> 00:27:39.575
but think about how Pepsi

00:27:39.694 --> 00:27:41.155
owns Mountain Dew and it

00:27:41.236 --> 00:27:44.417
owns KFC or whatever, it owns Taco Bell.

00:27:44.857 --> 00:27:45.397
One of those,

00:27:45.518 --> 00:27:47.638
Mr. Pibb was down and was causing

00:27:51.817 --> 00:27:52.897
problems that rippled across

00:27:52.917 --> 00:27:53.897
the whole system.

00:27:53.917 --> 00:27:55.740
We had to triage that and say, listen,

00:27:56.259 --> 00:27:57.721
we don't sell that much, Mr. Pibb.

00:27:58.221 --> 00:27:58.902
Shut it down.

00:27:59.082 --> 00:28:00.222
We don't care.

00:28:00.962 --> 00:28:01.564
It's interesting.

00:28:01.584 --> 00:28:02.483
We had to do that in real

00:28:02.523 --> 00:28:03.525
time while firefighting.

00:28:03.545 --> 00:28:05.506
That was a pretty exciting day.

00:28:05.906 --> 00:28:07.587
Same type of concept I see

00:28:07.607 --> 00:28:08.669
with the open source

00:28:08.709 --> 00:28:10.609
software versus paying Amazon.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:11.951
If you're a big company,

00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:12.751
you've got thousands of

00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:13.971
people and you can save

00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:14.833
millions of dollars,

00:28:15.153 --> 00:28:16.213
it makes sense to host your

00:28:16.314 --> 00:28:18.035
own cluster of XYZ.

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:20.537
But if you're a smaller company and

00:28:22.142 --> 00:28:23.482
The engineers are getting that, oh, yeah,

00:28:23.502 --> 00:28:24.463
my man hours are being

00:28:24.503 --> 00:28:25.905
wasted maintaining this thing,

00:28:26.125 --> 00:28:26.787
and we're only getting an

00:28:26.967 --> 00:28:29.170
ROI of one-third of what my

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.711
man hours are spent, you know,

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:31.632
what they're paying me to

00:28:31.672 --> 00:28:32.693
maintain this cluster.

00:28:32.733 --> 00:28:34.055
Then what are we doing it for?

00:28:34.075 --> 00:28:34.655
You know,

00:28:34.695 --> 00:28:37.239
so that's a very important skill that,

00:28:37.358 --> 00:28:38.180
yeah, you're right,

00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:39.101
I don't teach in schools.

00:28:41.464 --> 00:28:41.924
Yeah, for sure.

00:28:42.005 --> 00:28:42.766
I think it's something I've

00:28:42.786 --> 00:28:44.166
said on this podcast at,

00:28:44.366 --> 00:28:46.407
at least a billion times,

00:28:46.627 --> 00:28:49.990
like no company cares about

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.011
how tight and compact and

00:28:52.031 --> 00:28:54.992
efficient your Docker file is.

00:28:55.413 --> 00:28:57.275
And because they only care

00:28:57.295 --> 00:28:58.214
about what value it's

00:28:58.255 --> 00:28:59.296
providing to the customers

00:28:59.336 --> 00:29:01.617
who are paying money to that business.

00:29:01.718 --> 00:29:02.817
And I think that's the

00:29:02.837 --> 00:29:03.979
biggest career advice

00:29:04.058 --> 00:29:05.400
anyone in this industry can

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.662
learn is your technical skills are

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.232
a tool used by the business.

00:29:13.272 --> 00:29:14.252
They're not the product.

00:29:17.075 --> 00:29:17.715
And to be clear,

00:29:17.736 --> 00:29:18.957
I'm not saying there's one

00:29:19.017 --> 00:29:19.876
right answer for the other.

00:29:19.916 --> 00:29:20.857
You've got to take into

00:29:20.897 --> 00:29:22.598
account the bigger picture and say,

00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:24.800
you know, we're a company this size,

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:25.641
you know,

00:29:26.321 --> 00:29:27.222
how much time should I be

00:29:27.242 --> 00:29:27.982
spending on this?

00:29:28.042 --> 00:29:29.344
Or is that moving the needle

00:29:29.364 --> 00:29:29.923
for the company?

00:29:29.943 --> 00:29:30.305
You know,

00:29:30.325 --> 00:29:31.846
because you always got to pick what,

00:29:32.006 --> 00:29:33.787
you know, is important there.

00:29:33.807 --> 00:29:34.228
So I'm sorry,

00:29:34.268 --> 00:29:35.468
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

00:29:35.488 --> 00:29:36.729
No, I was done.

00:29:37.028 --> 00:29:37.710
That was it.

00:29:38.829 --> 00:29:39.029
I mean,

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.334
I think this goes in another

00:29:40.354 --> 00:29:41.316
direction as well,

00:29:41.435 --> 00:29:42.920
and I'm sort of curious your perspective,

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.181
Matt,

00:29:43.622 --> 00:29:45.907
is that right now I know there's a...

00:29:48.125 --> 00:29:48.685
Allegedly,

00:29:50.326 --> 00:29:52.008
the job economy is not great for

00:29:52.127 --> 00:29:52.827
knowledge workers,

00:29:53.308 --> 00:29:56.869
and I'm curious if you see

00:29:57.891 --> 00:30:00.251
particular opportunities in some way,

00:30:00.372 --> 00:30:02.153
or really, how do you stand out?

00:30:03.393 --> 00:30:04.374
Are there particular things

00:30:04.394 --> 00:30:06.734
that do help engineers in

00:30:06.775 --> 00:30:08.256
this area or throughout the

00:30:08.296 --> 00:30:10.297
industry stand out compared to,

00:30:10.696 --> 00:30:12.778
we talked about AI-generated resumes,

00:30:13.817 --> 00:30:15.398
or other aspects that they

00:30:15.419 --> 00:30:16.098
could really lay on?

00:30:16.199 --> 00:30:17.000
Any thoughts on that?

00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:19.077
Yes, tons.

00:30:21.919 --> 00:30:24.760
The first thing is that I'm

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.101
actively talking to several

00:30:26.141 --> 00:30:27.382
companies that are creating

00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:29.323
large language models, LLMs,

00:30:29.863 --> 00:30:32.403
to basically replace me and

00:30:32.625 --> 00:30:33.904
my designs so they can just

00:30:34.125 --> 00:30:35.746
put in words and then it

00:30:35.786 --> 00:30:37.666
spits up Terraform and it goes.

00:30:38.487 --> 00:30:39.268
They're not there yet.

00:30:39.288 --> 00:30:40.949
They're a long way from it,

00:30:40.969 --> 00:30:41.689
be able to maintain it,

00:30:41.709 --> 00:30:42.388
but they'll get there.

00:30:42.849 --> 00:30:44.790
That means I'm out.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:45.730
That's my whole job there.

00:30:48.035 --> 00:30:49.675
just like elevator operators

00:30:49.915 --> 00:30:50.415
back in the day.

00:30:50.435 --> 00:30:51.276
When was the last time you

00:30:51.296 --> 00:30:52.977
saw an elevator operator?

00:30:52.997 --> 00:30:53.876
Been quite some time.

00:30:54.376 --> 00:30:56.018
So who wants to stand in a

00:30:56.057 --> 00:30:58.038
hot box with people's

00:30:58.439 --> 00:30:59.719
enclosed space like that,

00:30:59.759 --> 00:31:01.680
especially after COVID and everything?

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.099
Oh my gosh, no.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.020
So no more elevator operators,

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.902
but they need engineers to

00:31:07.461 --> 00:31:08.362
maintain those things.

00:31:09.442 --> 00:31:10.423
Those things fall apart.

00:31:10.462 --> 00:31:11.603
That could be real bad for you.

00:31:11.623 --> 00:31:13.644
So you've got to evolve.

00:31:13.763 --> 00:31:15.805
That's something that I can't,

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.861
They're like, okay,

00:31:21.921 --> 00:31:22.820
I'm going to be the one

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:24.221
typing in the code for the

00:31:24.261 --> 00:31:25.603
CSS or pixel pusher.

00:31:25.623 --> 00:31:26.083
And you're like, no,

00:31:26.103 --> 00:31:28.263
you want to be a step above that.

00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:31.005
And you want to find that next step.

00:31:31.125 --> 00:31:33.606
So things I do to stand out, I mean,

00:31:34.606 --> 00:31:36.288
I make sure they see my face.

00:31:36.448 --> 00:31:37.808
I do a ton of content on stuff.

00:31:37.828 --> 00:31:40.430
I try and, you know, basically, I mean,

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:41.951
I'll be honest with my content.

00:31:41.971 --> 00:31:43.451
Sometimes I'm just reading in the news.

00:31:43.672 --> 00:31:44.451
And that way they see my

00:31:44.491 --> 00:31:45.833
face and they can recognize me there.

00:31:46.636 --> 00:31:47.357
But that's something I

00:31:47.417 --> 00:31:48.538
personally had to get over.

00:31:48.558 --> 00:31:49.778
I'm an introvert, oddly enough.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.819
I probably don't seem it,

00:31:50.839 --> 00:31:52.060
but I introvert by nature,

00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:53.422
extrovert by necessity.

00:31:53.922 --> 00:31:55.002
So, you know,

00:31:55.042 --> 00:31:56.304
don't be afraid to make

00:31:56.344 --> 00:31:57.365
videos about stuff.

00:31:57.384 --> 00:31:58.905
Some of my videos, one of my videos from,

00:31:59.365 --> 00:32:00.106
this always bugs me,

00:32:00.146 --> 00:32:01.166
but I did a video where I

00:32:01.188 --> 00:32:02.729
was trilaborating Wi-Fi

00:32:02.769 --> 00:32:05.069
signals in between projects

00:32:05.349 --> 00:32:06.932
to track down printers and

00:32:06.971 --> 00:32:08.772
different things just

00:32:08.792 --> 00:32:09.834
because I was bored out of

00:32:09.854 --> 00:32:11.255
my mind and I put it on YouTube.

00:32:11.275 --> 00:32:12.194
And it's still one of my

00:32:12.234 --> 00:32:14.817
most popular videos and I don't do that.

00:32:14.836 --> 00:32:16.077
I have no cap, I have no,

00:32:16.641 --> 00:32:19.082
So this stuff like that, you know,

00:32:19.122 --> 00:32:20.862
the communication, that's a huge skill.

00:32:20.902 --> 00:32:21.582
You need to, I mean,

00:32:21.602 --> 00:32:23.002
even if you're typing into an LLM,

00:32:23.242 --> 00:32:24.323
some guy in a suit is going

00:32:24.343 --> 00:32:25.423
to come up and say, Hey,

00:32:25.482 --> 00:32:27.503
we need this bigger picture thing.

00:32:27.983 --> 00:32:28.923
And then you can sure go

00:32:28.943 --> 00:32:30.105
ahead and type to our army

00:32:30.125 --> 00:32:32.025
of LLMs and have it generated.

00:32:32.045 --> 00:32:33.665
But if they can't do that prompt,

00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:35.105
there's value to you doing that.

00:32:35.125 --> 00:32:37.027
So find a way to bridge that

00:32:37.047 --> 00:32:38.507
gap between human and machine.

00:32:38.547 --> 00:32:38.787
It's just,

00:32:38.807 --> 00:32:40.267
we're just changing the way that works,

00:32:40.728 --> 00:32:41.147
you know?

00:32:41.748 --> 00:32:44.828
So find ways to add value to other people.

00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:46.128
That's one thing I obsess over.

00:32:49.383 --> 00:32:51.443
Now that this tool here, my winners,

00:32:51.503 --> 00:32:52.644
I'm going to send right to my clients.

00:32:52.664 --> 00:32:53.684
They're like, you need a guy?

00:32:53.884 --> 00:32:54.545
I need a girl.

00:32:54.565 --> 00:32:55.625
I need a person, whatever.

00:32:56.046 --> 00:32:57.126
Here you go.

00:32:58.166 --> 00:32:58.948
This one just won.

00:32:58.968 --> 00:33:00.468
This one solved my puzzle in

00:33:00.627 --> 00:33:01.608
two seconds flat.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:04.890
Yeah, that's what I would do.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:05.451
Communicate.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:05.810
That's it.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.652
Give them a wide surface area.

00:33:07.692 --> 00:33:08.652
Don't communicate the same

00:33:08.672 --> 00:33:09.353
way everybody else does.

00:33:09.373 --> 00:33:11.032
There's a reason I use pixel

00:33:11.093 --> 00:33:11.594
art everywhere.

00:33:11.953 --> 00:33:13.253
People remember it.

00:33:13.473 --> 00:33:14.535
I love my clients' death.

00:33:14.894 --> 00:33:16.336
They gamed as kids.

00:33:16.655 --> 00:33:17.977
We're at the perfect age to game as kids.

00:33:17.997 --> 00:33:18.757
They remembered

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.405
know mario bros and so they

00:33:21.425 --> 00:33:22.387
see that and they remember

00:33:22.428 --> 00:33:25.494
so stand out and and and

00:33:26.076 --> 00:33:27.941
communicate you know

00:33:29.151 --> 00:33:30.432
I love the perspective on

00:33:30.731 --> 00:33:31.751
spend some time creating

00:33:31.811 --> 00:33:33.732
content because it really

00:33:33.772 --> 00:33:34.792
does resonate with the

00:33:35.593 --> 00:33:36.292
there's only so much you

00:33:36.333 --> 00:33:38.013
can do of practicing

00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:39.634
LeetCode interviews or

00:33:39.934 --> 00:33:41.275
learning a new programming language.

00:33:41.315 --> 00:33:42.914
But really take that next

00:33:42.935 --> 00:33:44.935
step of doing literally anything else.

00:33:45.336 --> 00:33:47.057
If everyone's focusing on tech,

00:33:47.196 --> 00:33:48.356
focus on creating content

00:33:48.457 --> 00:33:50.857
or making some artwork or

00:33:51.758 --> 00:33:53.038
using LLMs or whatnot or

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:56.000
hand-drawn or making comics

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.122
because that is some way

00:33:57.142 --> 00:33:58.242
that you can really stand out.

00:33:58.262 --> 00:33:59.403
You can put on your resume, oh yeah,

00:33:59.565 --> 00:34:02.186
and also all of these comics are me.

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:03.648
This is something about me

00:34:03.689 --> 00:34:04.670
that really stands out,

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.330
that's unique for who I am

00:34:06.371 --> 00:34:07.372
compared to everyone else

00:34:07.392 --> 00:34:09.855
who's trying to compete for the same job.

00:34:10.155 --> 00:34:11.056
I think right now,

00:34:11.255 --> 00:34:13.177
I think this is always true,

00:34:13.318 --> 00:34:14.880
it's always now is the best

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.822
time to say even start your own company.

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.822
I see like a lot of resumes

00:34:19.202 --> 00:34:20.523
are like practice projects

00:34:20.603 --> 00:34:22.802
by engineers who are interested, like, oh,

00:34:22.882 --> 00:34:23.663
I made a recommendation

00:34:23.722 --> 00:34:24.784
engine or I made this other thing.

00:34:24.903 --> 00:34:26.284
And the most important

00:34:26.324 --> 00:34:27.184
question I always ask is,

00:34:27.443 --> 00:34:28.184
why did you do that?

00:34:28.463 --> 00:34:29.985
Like, what was your end goal here?

00:34:30.005 --> 00:34:30.625
And it's like, oh,

00:34:30.684 --> 00:34:31.585
I just wanted to do a project.

00:34:31.605 --> 00:34:32.204
I'm like, OK, well,

00:34:32.224 --> 00:34:33.324
that doesn't really mean anything to me.

00:34:33.344 --> 00:34:36.385
You had no bounds, no, no restrictions,

00:34:36.465 --> 00:34:38.547
no constraints on what you were doing.

00:34:38.567 --> 00:34:39.907
You just went wherever you felt like it.

00:34:40.266 --> 00:34:41.567
What's way more interesting is, oh,

00:34:41.806 --> 00:34:42.586
I was actually trying to

00:34:42.606 --> 00:34:43.628
make a business or I was

00:34:43.688 --> 00:34:45.047
actually trying to automate my

00:34:45.847 --> 00:34:47.349
my pictures being uploaded

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:48.389
to LinkedIn or whatever.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:48.670
And like,

00:34:48.751 --> 00:34:49.831
I had a real problem that I

00:34:49.871 --> 00:34:50.811
actually needed to solve.

00:34:51.052 --> 00:34:52.634
And this is how I went about solving it.

00:34:52.673 --> 00:34:53.474
That's a way more

00:34:53.554 --> 00:34:55.416
interesting thing to hear

00:34:55.635 --> 00:34:56.697
as a potential interviewer.

00:34:56.737 --> 00:34:58.097
So, you know, the content's great.

00:34:58.137 --> 00:34:59.338
The web comics are great.

00:34:59.358 --> 00:34:59.519
You know,

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:00.981
anything that really makes you

00:35:01.621 --> 00:35:04.543
stand out as an individual.

00:35:04.563 --> 00:35:04.684
Yeah.

00:35:04.844 --> 00:35:06.105
Another thing that pops into

00:35:06.125 --> 00:35:07.365
mind is the T skill set.

00:35:07.385 --> 00:35:07.967
You know,

00:35:07.987 --> 00:35:09.248
you don't want to be a generalist.

00:35:09.367 --> 00:35:10.748
You know, if you can find a niche,

00:35:10.768 --> 00:35:11.989
a niche that's in demand,

00:35:13.498 --> 00:35:14.838
you know, then folks are,

00:35:14.878 --> 00:35:15.798
I think my AWS niche for my

00:35:15.818 --> 00:35:16.980
consulting business is too wide.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.860
I'm trying to figure out how

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.940
to like zero that in.

00:35:18.981 --> 00:35:20.961
Like maybe I'm just going to do WAF,

00:35:20.981 --> 00:35:21.342
you know,

00:35:21.461 --> 00:35:22.722
or now that I've got these trainings,

00:35:22.762 --> 00:35:23.722
I'm probably going to focus on that.

00:35:23.762 --> 00:35:24.563
But, you know,

00:35:24.583 --> 00:35:25.505
I was thinking about just

00:35:25.565 --> 00:35:27.085
being the WAF commander,

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:28.206
web application firewall,

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:29.186
because I fight DDoS

00:35:29.246 --> 00:35:30.666
attacks all day long and I

00:35:30.686 --> 00:35:33.748
could do a whole course on that.

00:35:33.849 --> 00:35:35.469
I know we teach a whole course on that.

00:35:35.489 --> 00:35:36.931
So, but yeah,

00:35:36.951 --> 00:35:38.552
find a niche that's in demand

00:35:38.652 --> 00:35:40.193
and dive on in and,

00:35:41.978 --> 00:35:43.860
I've got a discord full of a

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.101
hodgepodge of brand

00:35:45.121 --> 00:35:46.101
developers and they had

00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:48.804
these really cool projects, but they,

00:35:48.923 --> 00:35:50.324
that are niche and they,

00:35:50.445 --> 00:35:51.545
they just don't showcase them.

00:35:51.565 --> 00:35:52.925
And they tell you about it in Texas.

00:35:52.965 --> 00:35:56.028
Like you've got cameras everywhere.

00:35:56.048 --> 00:35:57.349
You're computing important screen,

00:35:57.369 --> 00:35:58.911
just screen recorded and

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.351
show this cool project, you know,

00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:02.353
off as much as you can.

00:36:02.373 --> 00:36:02.472
Yeah.

00:36:06.135 --> 00:36:06.295
Yeah.

00:36:06.315 --> 00:36:07.356
It's definitely, um,

00:36:09.021 --> 00:36:10.322
we're moving from like a

00:36:10.402 --> 00:36:13.286
technical marketplace to a

00:36:13.385 --> 00:36:14.726
creator marketplace.

00:36:14.907 --> 00:36:15.168
And it's,

00:36:16.009 --> 00:36:17.269
I think what both of you are

00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:18.471
saying really highlights

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.592
that it's the technical

00:36:20.612 --> 00:36:22.295
skills are the foundation,

00:36:22.655 --> 00:36:24.496
but then as the creator,

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:26.759
you have to showcase and

00:36:27.099 --> 00:36:28.320
market those to make you

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.802
stand out and then identify like,

00:36:31.724 --> 00:36:32.945
here's the thing that I do

00:36:33.065 --> 00:36:36.148
like on the T like you've

00:36:36.168 --> 00:36:37.329
got the top line of the T

00:36:37.369 --> 00:36:38.710
here where everyone has the

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:39.389
same skillset.

00:36:39.409 --> 00:36:40.851
And then here's where I go deep.

00:36:41.811 --> 00:36:42.932
Yeah.

00:36:42.952 --> 00:36:44.394
I'm not saying don't, you know,

00:36:44.454 --> 00:36:46.255
don't learn things outside your purview,

00:36:46.295 --> 00:36:47.858
but don't make that your

00:36:47.898 --> 00:36:49.059
public facing persona.

00:36:49.079 --> 00:36:51.179
You know, you, I,

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.460
I know how to do a lot of things.

00:36:52.581 --> 00:36:56.425
I could do WordPress to anybody ever,

00:36:56.804 --> 00:36:57.965
but you know,

00:36:58.268 --> 00:36:59.489
Because publicly,

00:36:59.969 --> 00:37:00.969
I have a very particular

00:37:00.989 --> 00:37:01.849
thing I talk about.

00:37:02.409 --> 00:37:03.250
And you've got a very short

00:37:03.269 --> 00:37:03.989
amount of time to get

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.871
people's attention right

00:37:04.911 --> 00:37:07.271
now with all the spam and

00:37:07.311 --> 00:37:08.032
garbage out there.

00:37:08.052 --> 00:37:09.012
So you've got to figure out

00:37:09.052 --> 00:37:10.193
a way to do that very

00:37:10.213 --> 00:37:12.253
quickly and find people

00:37:12.293 --> 00:37:15.635
that have your problem.

00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:16.635
I solve million-dollar

00:37:16.655 --> 00:37:17.735
problems for some of my clients.

00:37:29.615 --> 00:37:30.376
Everybody find the

00:37:30.416 --> 00:37:31.195
businesses that are

00:37:31.255 --> 00:37:33.077
suffering from your stuff.

00:37:33.097 --> 00:37:33.237
I mean,

00:37:33.336 --> 00:37:34.817
I've got criteria that I use for

00:37:34.836 --> 00:37:35.536
lead gen work.

00:37:35.916 --> 00:37:36.577
They are, they run AWS.

00:37:36.597 --> 00:37:36.697
Great.

00:37:36.717 --> 00:37:37.396
You know,

00:37:38.137 --> 00:37:39.757
I have a very specific size requirement.

00:37:39.777 --> 00:37:40.617
I don't want to be too big.

00:37:40.838 --> 00:37:41.757
Got an HR department.

00:37:41.777 --> 00:37:42.557
You're probably bigger than

00:37:42.958 --> 00:37:43.577
you don't need me.

00:37:43.958 --> 00:37:45.699
And then if you've gone down

00:37:45.759 --> 00:37:47.539
recently that I'm talking

00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:48.318
to you because you've,

00:37:48.478 --> 00:37:49.278
you've got the pain.

00:37:49.298 --> 00:37:49.878
You've like,

00:37:49.898 --> 00:37:50.940
if your site's slowing down

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.679
because you're growing too fast,

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.800
I want to talk to you right

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.260
away and you want to talk to me.

00:37:55.679 --> 00:37:57.260
So if you have that criteria,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.081
then it makes it so,

00:38:04.114 --> 00:38:07.635
out to the Lambo Joe's that

00:38:07.695 --> 00:38:10.137
doesn't have the need that

00:38:10.177 --> 00:38:10.836
you can scratch.

00:38:10.856 --> 00:38:12.757
You want to be like, this is your problem.

00:38:13.219 --> 00:38:14.559
This is my expertise.

00:38:14.599 --> 00:38:16.179
This is how I can solve that problem.

00:38:16.219 --> 00:38:17.121
This is how I've solved it a

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:17.681
hundred times.

00:38:17.721 --> 00:38:18.300
Case studies.

00:38:18.681 --> 00:38:19.481
It's a big thing I'm working

00:38:19.541 --> 00:38:20.342
on this year is getting

00:38:20.422 --> 00:38:21.782
more case studies on my website.

00:38:22.103 --> 00:38:23.443
Show them how you solve that

00:38:23.483 --> 00:38:24.083
exact problem.

00:38:25.217 --> 00:38:26.358
Put a coin in me, I'm going to keep going.

00:38:26.378 --> 00:38:28.240
Yeah, definitely.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.802
Now I'm going to ask you another question.

00:38:31.483 --> 00:38:33.664
The sort of issues that you

00:38:33.724 --> 00:38:35.085
see come up for each of

00:38:35.106 --> 00:38:36.907
your customers and from your experience,

00:38:36.967 --> 00:38:38.027
do you feel like they are

00:38:38.108 --> 00:38:39.829
sort of repetitive in any way?

00:38:39.849 --> 00:38:41.291
Like, oh, you've seen this problem before?

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:43.632
Or do you see that some of these problems,

00:38:43.652 --> 00:38:45.534
they are actually nuanced

00:38:45.614 --> 00:38:47.275
and new in some way that

00:38:47.315 --> 00:38:48.536
you haven't experienced?

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:52.498
Yes and no.

00:38:52.559 --> 00:38:53.420
The people problems I see,

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:56.211
That pops up quite a bit.

00:38:56.231 --> 00:38:57.572
So I don't do a lot of

00:38:57.632 --> 00:38:58.873
hands-on work for my clients.

00:38:58.913 --> 00:39:00.634
I do advisory and oversight quite a bit.

00:39:01.155 --> 00:39:02.996
So they pair me with a project manager,

00:39:03.576 --> 00:39:04.936
and they say, we've got this problem.

00:39:05.717 --> 00:39:06.858
We want to scale up to this thing.

00:39:06.918 --> 00:39:07.619
I do a design,

00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:08.998
and then I work with PM to

00:39:09.018 --> 00:39:10.340
hand that off to other people to do.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.320
So I train other people.

00:39:11.641 --> 00:39:12.280
I see a lot of people

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.661
problems that are repetitive.

00:39:14.262 --> 00:39:15.402
The technology problem, yes,

00:39:16.143 --> 00:39:17.204
nine times out of ten,

00:39:17.945 --> 00:39:19.286
it's a security group problem.

00:39:19.306 --> 00:39:21.427
So that's true.

00:39:22.414 --> 00:39:24.755
But with that said, past that,

00:39:24.775 --> 00:39:26.016
there's always new technologies.

00:39:26.056 --> 00:39:27.396
We're getting DDoSed in ways

00:39:27.476 --> 00:39:28.836
I've never seen before.

00:39:28.956 --> 00:39:30.097
It's quite fascinating.

00:39:31.378 --> 00:39:33.278
Actually, if you guys will indulge me,

00:39:33.298 --> 00:39:34.759
I've got one kind of more

00:39:34.818 --> 00:39:35.940
prop like the game that you

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.820
guys might find interesting real quick.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.920
I'm going to digitize this.

00:39:42.882 --> 00:39:43.681
Oh, no, the spinners.

00:39:43.782 --> 00:39:44.521
I lost the spinner.

00:39:44.561 --> 00:39:44.902
Oh, well.

00:39:47.804 --> 00:39:49.184
So you talk about repetitive stuff.

00:39:50.324 --> 00:39:52.545
When I had some mid-level junior devs,

00:39:52.565 --> 00:39:53.445
a lot of times they'd get

00:39:53.465 --> 00:39:55.606
stuck on things and they'd be like,

00:39:55.666 --> 00:39:56.306
I don't know what to do.

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:56.806
I don't know what to do.

00:39:56.847 --> 00:39:59.568
They'd come up to me and a

00:39:59.628 --> 00:40:00.927
lot of times it became repetitive.

00:40:00.947 --> 00:40:03.469
So I took the top like ten

00:40:03.509 --> 00:40:04.568
or twenty things that,

00:40:04.588 --> 00:40:06.590
I don't know how many things it is,

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:07.849
that was happening,

00:40:07.889 --> 00:40:09.731
including check the security group,

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.891
you know,

00:40:10.931 --> 00:40:12.072
and I put a spinner on this

00:40:12.092 --> 00:40:12.652
thing and I said,

00:40:12.692 --> 00:40:14.813
you can't bug me until

00:40:14.833 --> 00:40:16.572
you've spun it at least, you know,

00:40:16.693 --> 00:40:18.273
I think I said three times,

00:40:18.313 --> 00:40:19.293
tried three different things.

00:40:19.701 --> 00:40:20.461
I'm like,

00:40:20.481 --> 00:40:21.782
you got to tell me you've already

00:40:22.163 --> 00:40:23.523
checked the logs.

00:40:23.643 --> 00:40:24.244
You've already,

00:40:24.505 --> 00:40:27.547
I'm not going to explain

00:40:27.567 --> 00:40:30.409
that abbreviation, but, um, yeah,

00:40:30.429 --> 00:40:31.490
add more logging, you know?

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.092
So this is actually coming soon to, uh,

00:40:34.253 --> 00:40:36.014
to cloud at war games.

00:40:37.155 --> 00:40:39.697
Uh, for the beginners,

00:40:39.777 --> 00:40:40.617
I won't take this away from

00:40:40.637 --> 00:40:41.358
the advanced people.

00:40:41.579 --> 00:40:43.481
This is like, you got a free spin,

00:40:43.501 --> 00:40:43.981
you know, spin.

00:40:44.001 --> 00:40:44.201
Yeah.

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:45.161
And, uh,

00:40:46.516 --> 00:40:46.918
Exactly.

00:40:46.958 --> 00:40:47.880
Phone a friend.

00:40:48.922 --> 00:40:51.045
Ask your peer before you come asking me.

00:40:51.065 --> 00:40:52.027
Like another junior might

00:40:52.047 --> 00:40:52.748
actually have the solution

00:40:52.768 --> 00:40:54.532
to work together, collaborate people.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:56.512
And not just in the same company.

00:40:56.992 --> 00:40:57.733
I find that,

00:40:58.233 --> 00:41:00.253
especially above the senior level,

00:41:00.635 --> 00:41:02.235
a lot of engineers haven't

00:41:02.315 --> 00:41:03.657
realized that they can go

00:41:03.797 --> 00:41:05.657
outside the company to

00:41:05.818 --> 00:41:07.478
solicit assistance.

00:41:07.739 --> 00:41:08.760
You don't need to pay someone,

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.561
but there are communities

00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:11.041
out there that you can go to.

00:41:11.161 --> 00:41:14.744
And it's so ridiculous to me that at SMBs,

00:41:14.903 --> 00:41:15.905
small, medium businesses,

00:41:16.085 --> 00:41:21.329
not giant modelists, the FANG companies,

00:41:21.369 --> 00:41:21.469
etc.,

00:41:22.028 --> 00:41:22.989
you know at smaller sizes

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:23.969
you just don't have anyone

00:41:23.989 --> 00:41:24.811
that's more experienced

00:41:24.831 --> 00:41:25.590
than you in the company you

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:26.552
have no one to mentor you

00:41:26.612 --> 00:41:27.693
no one to sort of bounce

00:41:27.733 --> 00:41:28.813
ideas off of and they're

00:41:28.833 --> 00:41:29.673
like well what do I do and

00:41:29.693 --> 00:41:32.215
I'm like well how many how

00:41:32.235 --> 00:41:33.197
many discord servers are

00:41:33.237 --> 00:41:34.597
you in like I'm like in

00:41:34.858 --> 00:41:35.777
thirty or forty or

00:41:35.818 --> 00:41:36.978
something like there are

00:41:37.039 --> 00:41:38.039
those out there where

00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:39.260
people you know are willing

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.101
to provide assistance if

00:41:40.121 --> 00:41:41.041
you just ask the question

00:41:41.081 --> 00:41:42.822
publicly and the idea that

00:41:42.862 --> 00:41:44.103
they're just not even they

00:41:44.123 --> 00:41:44.983
don't even see this as an

00:41:45.023 --> 00:41:46.726
opportunity is like like

00:41:47.166 --> 00:41:48.686
really great additional

00:41:49.166 --> 00:41:50.268
source of valuable

00:41:50.288 --> 00:41:51.588
information that you're missing out on

00:41:51.969 --> 00:41:52.528
Yeah.

00:41:52.548 --> 00:41:52.829
I mean,

00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:54.369
that's part of the reason I am

00:41:54.389 --> 00:41:56.331
starting a community for my

00:41:56.351 --> 00:41:57.951
niche is that there's

00:41:58.351 --> 00:42:00.472
absolutely people are, you know,

00:42:00.492 --> 00:42:01.052
where do I go?

00:42:01.152 --> 00:42:01.972
Where do I go?

00:42:02.393 --> 00:42:03.952
I love that I've got these

00:42:03.972 --> 00:42:04.733
communities I can go to

00:42:04.753 --> 00:42:05.673
about my business and all

00:42:05.693 --> 00:42:06.014
that other stuff.

00:42:06.034 --> 00:42:09.054
But if you're an engineer and, you know,

00:42:09.074 --> 00:42:10.275
for a smaller company at least,

00:42:10.715 --> 00:42:11.715
and you're running on Amazon,

00:42:11.735 --> 00:42:12.815
like there's probably no

00:42:12.896 --> 00:42:13.795
one else that knows more

00:42:13.835 --> 00:42:16.496
than you and you need answers.

00:42:16.516 --> 00:42:18.498
And it's like, yeah, you take a course,

00:42:24.318 --> 00:42:25.438
that you can bounce off

00:42:25.458 --> 00:42:26.659
there's some additional

00:42:26.679 --> 00:42:27.860
value to it so that's with

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.460
all the ai going on you can

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.621
just chat gpt all day but

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.581
you know to have somebody

00:42:31.621 --> 00:42:32.842
else that actually breathes

00:42:32.882 --> 00:42:34.302
and has a pulse that

00:42:34.603 --> 00:42:35.902
understands your pain even

00:42:35.922 --> 00:42:37.204
sometimes you just event to

00:42:37.224 --> 00:42:38.445
about like oh it's the

00:42:38.465 --> 00:42:39.344
security group for the

00:42:39.385 --> 00:42:40.246
hundredth time why did I

00:42:40.266 --> 00:42:41.746
make that mistake again you

00:42:41.826 --> 00:42:44.387
know so uh I completely

00:42:44.407 --> 00:42:45.088
agree with you I think

00:42:45.108 --> 00:42:47.148
that's a huge value if

00:42:47.168 --> 00:42:48.329
you're not in one of those

00:42:48.489 --> 00:42:49.750
you know I would strongly recommend

00:42:52.505 --> 00:42:52.585
Yeah.

00:42:52.606 --> 00:42:53.447
And it seems like cloud war

00:42:53.467 --> 00:42:54.387
games is going to be like a

00:42:54.447 --> 00:42:56.009
foundation for helping you

00:42:56.068 --> 00:42:57.590
identify those groups.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:58.371
Cause you get in,

00:42:58.791 --> 00:42:59.431
you start working with

00:42:59.452 --> 00:43:00.652
people that you don't know.

00:43:01.313 --> 00:43:03.114
And then you just start

00:43:03.155 --> 00:43:03.775
chatting from there.

00:43:03.795 --> 00:43:04.635
It looks like those are just

00:43:04.655 --> 00:43:06.597
going to naturally form as

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:07.498
a result of this.

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:09.320
I would love that.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.780
I hope, I hope there's some, cause you,

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.161
you do get some good

00:43:12.202 --> 00:43:14.804
relationships that are formed in foxholes,

00:43:14.824 --> 00:43:16.746
so to say, you're in the fire there.

00:43:16.766 --> 00:43:18.447
It's like, you know, you, you, if,

00:43:19.106 --> 00:43:20.748
if someone cracks under pressure, you know,

00:43:20.768 --> 00:43:21.728
but yeah,

00:43:21.809 --> 00:43:22.648
I've got some guys that I'm

00:43:22.668 --> 00:43:23.550
pretty excited with because

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:26.293
we've sweated it out, you know,

00:43:26.393 --> 00:43:27.293
in bad times.

00:43:27.574 --> 00:43:28.974
And, you know, there's,

00:43:29.094 --> 00:43:31.297
you'd be amazed how quickly

00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:32.777
you forge those relationships.

00:43:32.978 --> 00:43:33.219
Sorry.

00:43:33.338 --> 00:43:34.400
Hopefully the audio is still good.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.940
Well, I mean, the,

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:37.809
The worse the situation is,

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:41.052
the more interesting and honestly,

00:43:41.112 --> 00:43:41.853
the thing that you can sort

00:43:41.873 --> 00:43:44.215
of look back at later to sort of enjoy it,

00:43:44.235 --> 00:43:46.157
the better the story it is that you can,

00:43:46.556 --> 00:43:48.458
you know, walk through like, oh,

00:43:48.478 --> 00:43:49.460
there was these decisions

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.601
that were made and there

00:43:50.621 --> 00:43:51.521
were problems there.

00:43:51.601 --> 00:43:52.461
And then and then you're

00:43:52.501 --> 00:43:53.603
able to tell that story later.

00:43:53.663 --> 00:43:53.762
Like,

00:43:53.802 --> 00:43:54.804
it's a much better story if

00:43:54.864 --> 00:43:55.704
everything just worked

00:43:55.885 --> 00:43:56.726
right all the time.

00:43:57.126 --> 00:43:57.987
Like your job would be

00:43:58.027 --> 00:43:59.146
boring and you would leave

00:43:59.266 --> 00:44:00.867
after when you retire and be like,

00:44:00.909 --> 00:44:01.809
you didn't do anything.

00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:03.010
But the fact you can look back and be like,

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:03.309
oh,

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:04.911
like there was one time the website

00:44:04.931 --> 00:44:05.851
was down because someone

00:44:05.891 --> 00:44:06.972
did this and it took forever.

00:44:06.992 --> 00:44:07.932
Like that's a great story

00:44:07.972 --> 00:44:08.512
that you can tell.

00:44:08.532 --> 00:44:08.632
Yeah.

00:44:09.193 --> 00:44:10.074
Yeah.

00:44:10.153 --> 00:44:11.255
I tell my parents this stuff.

00:44:11.275 --> 00:44:12.456
My mom's like, you know,

00:44:12.476 --> 00:44:13.335
I don't know how you can

00:44:13.416 --> 00:44:13.916
handle this stuff.

00:44:13.936 --> 00:44:14.657
This sounds so bad.

00:44:14.697 --> 00:44:15.398
I'm like, well,

00:44:15.438 --> 00:44:17.039
if this stuff didn't go down occasionally,

00:44:17.059 --> 00:44:17.659
we didn't get sorry.

00:44:17.699 --> 00:44:19.239
We didn't get attacked like this.

00:44:19.753 --> 00:44:20.673
then I wouldn't have a job.

00:44:20.733 --> 00:44:22.534
So, you know, it's kind of like, that's,

00:44:22.835 --> 00:44:25.077
there's, I find these kinds of outliers.

00:44:25.518 --> 00:44:26.478
The problem is you design a

00:44:26.539 --> 00:44:27.380
system that's so solid,

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:28.219
it doesn't go down.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.961
So then they don't need you anymore.

00:44:30.001 --> 00:44:31.382
But luckily the internet's

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:32.704
full of evil people attacking us.

00:44:32.724 --> 00:44:35.166
So it gives me a job.

00:44:35.186 --> 00:44:35.346
Sorry.

00:44:35.365 --> 00:44:36.467
That sounds weird to say.

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.670
It's always opportunity somewhere.

00:44:41.331 --> 00:44:41.592
Yeah.

00:44:47.289 --> 00:44:50.693
right on so um you've been

00:44:51.534 --> 00:44:52.333
you're literally just a

00:44:52.454 --> 00:44:53.835
week into cloud war games

00:44:54.356 --> 00:44:55.777
right less than a week but

00:44:55.797 --> 00:44:57.898
yeah yeah what was the

00:44:57.938 --> 00:44:58.759
trigger that made you

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:04.003
decide to to to start this

00:45:04.885 --> 00:45:07.025
so I I had thought of it as

00:45:07.045 --> 00:45:08.588
a side part for my kind of

00:45:08.628 --> 00:45:09.588
community I was creating

00:45:09.608 --> 00:45:11.670
because I I wanted to help

00:45:11.769 --> 00:45:13.050
I'm trying my mission try

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:14.032
and find as many people

00:45:14.052 --> 00:45:15.193
that I can add value to their lives

00:45:15.797 --> 00:45:17.697
And, you know, some of my big clients,

00:45:17.958 --> 00:45:19.498
you know, that's, that's great.

00:45:19.518 --> 00:45:20.559
But what if a mom and pop

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.880
tiny little shop comes to

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.782
me and need something?

00:45:23.141 --> 00:45:24.202
I can't offer them as much

00:45:24.282 --> 00:45:24.882
one-on-one time.

00:45:24.902 --> 00:45:25.543
So I was like, I'll,

00:45:25.603 --> 00:45:27.644
I'll build a community and then they can,

00:45:28.045 --> 00:45:28.284
you know,

00:45:28.324 --> 00:45:29.266
share information just like

00:45:29.286 --> 00:45:30.126
we've been talking about

00:45:30.206 --> 00:45:31.487
and I can help more people

00:45:32.047 --> 00:45:33.728
and it works out for all of us.

00:45:33.809 --> 00:45:34.809
But then I was in the

00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:35.829
mastermind group and I was like,

00:45:35.889 --> 00:45:36.650
one of the events we're

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:37.650
going to do is the war gaming.

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:38.512
And they're like, no, no, no,

00:45:38.532 --> 00:45:39.972
that's the front and center thing.

00:45:40.012 --> 00:45:40.413
Like that's,

00:45:40.992 --> 00:45:42.514
I can see companies hire you

00:45:42.554 --> 00:45:43.534
just to go in and do war

00:45:43.554 --> 00:45:44.675
games or all these other things.

00:45:44.695 --> 00:45:45.175
And then,

00:45:45.677 --> 00:45:46.898
They got me hyped up and I'm like,

00:45:46.958 --> 00:45:47.697
I'll have it launched.

00:45:47.998 --> 00:45:49.079
I'll have it launched by tomorrow.

00:45:49.318 --> 00:45:50.179
And I said, I'll have it.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.101
I'll have a post.

00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:52.201
I'll have a video and I'll

00:45:52.221 --> 00:45:53.121
have a landing page.

00:45:53.822 --> 00:45:56.344
And I tied my hands because I,

00:45:56.384 --> 00:45:58.025
in the same way with a, I was like,

00:45:58.065 --> 00:45:58.626
no coding.

00:45:58.985 --> 00:45:59.646
Okay.

00:45:59.885 --> 00:46:01.206
You can't, no over-engineering.

00:46:01.226 --> 00:46:02.447
Luckily I'm a horrible designer.

00:46:02.487 --> 00:46:04.289
So I was like, I'm not going to design.

00:46:04.329 --> 00:46:05.289
I'll just use a template.

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.452
And I set up just a convertkit.com,

00:46:08.472 --> 00:46:09.432
this landing page.

00:46:10.018 --> 00:46:11.398
And I used Calendly to

00:46:11.458 --> 00:46:12.460
schedule the first couple

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.141
and I just wrote some emails there.

00:46:14.181 --> 00:46:15.021
So no coding.

00:46:15.041 --> 00:46:15.661
Cause I,

00:46:15.882 --> 00:46:17.121
I do have a tendency to

00:46:17.181 --> 00:46:18.463
over-engineer if I allow myself.

00:46:19.063 --> 00:46:23.746
And so here we are Monday

00:46:23.806 --> 00:46:25.246
morning and I had five

00:46:25.266 --> 00:46:26.547
people signed up and now

00:46:26.648 --> 00:46:27.449
it's doubled already.

00:46:27.489 --> 00:46:28.748
It's over doubled since then.

00:46:28.789 --> 00:46:30.170
So it's moving.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.152
And then now I'm on this podcast.

00:46:32.172 --> 00:46:32.771
So yeah,

00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:34.052
that was just the mastermind group.

00:46:34.072 --> 00:46:34.932
They focused me.

00:46:35.032 --> 00:46:35.733
It really was good.

00:46:35.753 --> 00:46:37.315
Just cut away the other stuff and focus,

00:46:37.335 --> 00:46:37.815
you know?

00:46:39.556 --> 00:46:40.597
yeah for sure that's like

00:46:40.637 --> 00:46:42.838
another um benefit of that

00:46:43.018 --> 00:46:45.641
is having people who will

00:46:48.063 --> 00:46:48.762
well like you said just

00:46:48.802 --> 00:46:49.744
focus you you know because

00:46:49.764 --> 00:46:51.284
we tend to over engineer it

00:46:51.304 --> 00:46:52.126
and you think oh man I've

00:46:52.166 --> 00:46:54.186
got to have a website and I

00:46:54.226 --> 00:46:56.548
need um a database to store

00:46:56.568 --> 00:46:58.250
the people's information

00:46:58.289 --> 00:46:59.550
and get their profiles and

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:01.271
I need authentication and

00:47:02.644 --> 00:47:03.465
But honestly,

00:47:03.525 --> 00:47:05.385
by having someone hold you

00:47:05.425 --> 00:47:06.266
accountable to it,

00:47:06.505 --> 00:47:09.306
you have the MVP in less

00:47:09.327 --> 00:47:11.626
than five days without

00:47:11.668 --> 00:47:12.608
having to do any of that

00:47:12.648 --> 00:47:13.728
stuff that's not actually

00:47:13.748 --> 00:47:16.568
going to test your idea or not.

00:47:16.588 --> 00:47:16.668
Yeah.

00:47:16.949 --> 00:47:19.570
And I will say there's also

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:20.510
some other factors here.

00:47:20.869 --> 00:47:21.909
It's a hot dog business

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:23.331
being as I had all these

00:47:23.371 --> 00:47:24.190
other ingredients just

00:47:24.271 --> 00:47:25.831
sitting around like I

00:47:25.891 --> 00:47:26.992
already have open source

00:47:27.012 --> 00:47:28.391
Terraform scripts I manage.

00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:30.132
And I used to run my entire

00:47:30.152 --> 00:47:30.913
infrastructure and some of

00:47:30.932 --> 00:47:31.592
my client stuff.

00:47:31.943 --> 00:47:33.264
So I already had that.

00:47:33.304 --> 00:47:34.105
And that's why I'm like, oh,

00:47:34.125 --> 00:47:35.666
I could spin up a domain

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:36.447
that we can knock down.

00:47:36.487 --> 00:47:39.048
Actually, I bought ExplodeMe.com yesterday,

00:47:39.088 --> 00:47:40.990
which is gonna be where we attack.

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:43.112
So I can spin that up.

00:47:43.193 --> 00:47:44.494
I mean, it's not quite ready yet,

00:47:44.514 --> 00:47:46.195
but I can have it up in a few hours.

00:47:46.215 --> 00:47:47.597
But all I gotta do is take

00:47:47.637 --> 00:47:48.476
some of these scenarios

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:49.358
that I've got written down

00:47:49.378 --> 00:47:50.318
and make them more formal.

00:48:02.125 --> 00:48:03.744
I was trying to like hot dogs,

00:48:03.764 --> 00:48:04.985
a bunch of other pieces of

00:48:05.085 --> 00:48:05.806
meat that you got,

00:48:06.206 --> 00:48:07.065
the little leavings of you

00:48:07.085 --> 00:48:07.826
put them together and now

00:48:07.846 --> 00:48:08.706
you got hot dogs and

00:48:08.726 --> 00:48:09.766
baloney or whatever else.

00:48:09.786 --> 00:48:10.347
So,

00:48:11.027 --> 00:48:13.128
so that was uniquely that I was lucky

00:48:13.168 --> 00:48:13.807
enough to have that,

00:48:13.827 --> 00:48:15.788
fortunate enough to have that.

00:48:15.887 --> 00:48:18.389
So.

00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:18.708
Right on.

00:48:19.168 --> 00:48:19.889
How long have you been in

00:48:20.228 --> 00:48:21.188
the mastermind groups?

00:48:21.449 --> 00:48:25.050
How long have you been doing that?

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:26.291
Yeah, on and off throughout the years,

00:48:26.331 --> 00:48:28.871
but I, over the last two years,

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.231
I really went heads down.

00:48:31.532 --> 00:48:31.552
I,

00:48:32.559 --> 00:48:34.121
I hired a business coach and

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.780
I think it was twenty twenty two.

00:48:36.101 --> 00:48:37.141
They didn't quite work out.

00:48:37.161 --> 00:48:38.822
But then I found this solo

00:48:39.181 --> 00:48:41.583
expertise one in twenty twenty three.

00:48:42.262 --> 00:48:43.643
The beginning of that, that was great.

00:48:43.704 --> 00:48:45.003
I actually ended up engaging

00:48:45.043 --> 00:48:46.244
the founder of that for a

00:48:46.344 --> 00:48:47.385
one on one coaching.

00:48:47.885 --> 00:48:49.184
And we met yesterday.

00:48:49.204 --> 00:48:50.085
It's phenomenal.

00:48:50.146 --> 00:48:53.067
And I threw a parallel.

00:48:53.186 --> 00:48:54.007
I found a parallel group

00:48:54.027 --> 00:48:54.947
that was more hands off

00:48:54.987 --> 00:48:56.847
small best dot com that

00:48:57.307 --> 00:48:58.668
then I found another person

00:48:58.688 --> 00:48:59.849
for another mastermind group.

00:49:00.389 --> 00:49:02.090
that was more hands-on and I

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:03.090
jumped in with them and I

00:49:03.572 --> 00:49:05.952
think I almost mentor them

00:49:05.992 --> 00:49:07.012
as much as they mentor me

00:49:07.052 --> 00:49:08.454
luckily at this point, but yeah,

00:49:08.474 --> 00:49:09.795
that's what a mastermind group is.

00:49:09.815 --> 00:49:11.775
So that's, that's been, uh,

00:49:11.795 --> 00:49:12.576
it was about nine months

00:49:12.596 --> 00:49:13.657
ago there and I'm looking

00:49:13.697 --> 00:49:14.817
for more and I'm probably

00:49:14.836 --> 00:49:15.518
going to start another one

00:49:15.538 --> 00:49:16.318
in the next few weeks.

00:49:17.039 --> 00:49:18.498
Well, maybe months,

00:49:18.539 --> 00:49:19.380
I should say next few months,

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.719
I'm going to finish.

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:21.161
Right on.

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:25.663
Cool.

00:49:26.903 --> 00:49:27.603
And then your, um,

00:49:29.554 --> 00:49:32.536
your cartoons that you release,

00:49:32.896 --> 00:49:33.576
where do you release those

00:49:33.655 --> 00:49:35.597
at for anyone who wants to see those?

00:49:37.157 --> 00:49:39.518
I have my mailing lists, my socials,

00:49:39.719 --> 00:49:41.280
and then I push them.

00:49:42.519 --> 00:49:43.960
If they're relative to Terraform,

00:49:44.021 --> 00:49:44.561
I push them in those

00:49:44.601 --> 00:49:45.862
Terraform groups here and there,

00:49:45.981 --> 00:49:46.842
r slash Terraform.

00:49:46.902 --> 00:49:48.282
If they're relevant,

00:49:48.302 --> 00:49:49.324
r slash Programmer Humor,

00:49:49.344 --> 00:49:51.284
that's where I launch a bunch of them.

00:49:51.304 --> 00:49:52.045
Those are the ones where I

00:49:52.065 --> 00:49:52.885
get the most views.

00:49:52.905 --> 00:49:53.286
Yeah.

00:49:53.405 --> 00:49:53.766
Yeah.

00:49:55.686 --> 00:49:57.608
Yeah.

00:50:00.463 --> 00:50:03.186
And there was one week when there was,

00:50:03.206 --> 00:50:03.706
yeah, there was nevermind.

00:50:03.865 --> 00:50:04.347
There was one that was

00:50:04.367 --> 00:50:05.447
relevant to something we

00:50:05.467 --> 00:50:05.987
said earlier that I just

00:50:06.027 --> 00:50:06.588
came out last week,

00:50:06.728 --> 00:50:07.809
but I don't think I can

00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:08.489
connect the threads anymore.

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:12.251
So the one you sent that

00:50:12.291 --> 00:50:13.913
cracked me up was the, um,

00:50:13.932 --> 00:50:14.753
the Y two K one.

00:50:15.014 --> 00:50:19.956
Cause I like, I know people that in,

00:50:20.396 --> 00:50:22.557
they went into bunkers and

00:50:22.597 --> 00:50:23.759
I've never seen them since.

00:50:23.778 --> 00:50:26.201
And so pretty frequently I wonder like,

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:26.521
wow,

00:50:27.878 --> 00:50:28.197
did they,

00:50:28.297 --> 00:50:29.079
cause some of them were going to

00:50:29.119 --> 00:50:30.278
stay in their bunkers for like,

00:50:30.338 --> 00:50:32.621
ten or twenty years, and I was like,

00:50:32.641 --> 00:50:33.561
did they stay?

00:50:34.101 --> 00:50:35.422
Like, are they still alive?

00:50:36.382 --> 00:50:37.762
What happened when they came out?

00:50:38.123 --> 00:50:39.304
And I don't know where any of them are.

00:50:40.545 --> 00:50:41.724
Yeah, I got to thinking, I was,

00:50:41.744 --> 00:50:42.706
this could be an annual one,

00:50:42.726 --> 00:50:43.286
cause this is actually a

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:45.367
release on the thirty-first of December,

00:50:45.728 --> 00:50:46.188
but I got to thinking,

00:50:46.248 --> 00:50:47.208
what's the dumbest thing

00:50:47.228 --> 00:50:48.329
that you could go back into

00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:49.530
a bunker and live your life

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:50.409
in hiding for?

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:52.331
Javascript everywhere?

00:50:52.411 --> 00:50:52.590
What?

00:50:55.277 --> 00:50:56.199
And they had a little bit of

00:50:56.259 --> 00:50:57.519
a controversy to it because, you know,

00:50:57.539 --> 00:50:57.860
of course,

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:58.900
there's like half the Internet

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.280
hates JavaScript and half

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.882
the Internet's like JavaScript.

00:51:01.902 --> 00:51:02.742
Let's put it in everything.

00:51:03.302 --> 00:51:03.802
Right.

00:51:04.143 --> 00:51:04.583
That helped.

00:51:04.643 --> 00:51:06.985
It definitely helped it go up the numbers.

00:51:08.246 --> 00:51:09.286
Sure, sure.

00:51:09.306 --> 00:51:09.887
I mean, if people,

00:51:10.907 --> 00:51:12.349
I know about this controversy and I just,

00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:14.070
I wonder if the people who

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:16.331
are against JavaScript will

00:51:16.391 --> 00:51:18.313
be more in favor or against

00:51:18.373 --> 00:51:20.114
whatever LLM generated

00:51:20.155 --> 00:51:21.094
programming language the

00:51:21.155 --> 00:51:22.175
whole world ends up

00:51:22.295 --> 00:51:24.036
utilizing in the future.

00:51:24.077 --> 00:51:24.217
I mean,

00:51:24.237 --> 00:51:25.478
we'll be forced by our robot

00:51:25.579 --> 00:51:28.019
overlords to use the one

00:51:28.039 --> 00:51:29.001
true programming language,

00:51:29.021 --> 00:51:29.742
whatever that is.

00:51:30.382 --> 00:51:31.762
And I wonder if they'll be

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:33.023
okay with that or whether

00:51:33.043 --> 00:51:34.804
or not they'll have wished

00:51:34.844 --> 00:51:35.865
to go back to the days of

00:51:35.925 --> 00:51:36.947
JavaScript and everything.

00:51:38.257 --> 00:51:41.918
You just gave me an idea for a camera.

00:51:42.259 --> 00:51:42.820
We're arguing about

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.641
JavaScript versus not JavaScript.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:45.900
But what about,

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.661
we can all agree that

00:51:46.702 --> 00:51:47.702
people that use no code

00:51:47.742 --> 00:51:48.762
solutions are fools.

00:51:53.525 --> 00:51:54.505
I think I probably get

00:51:54.987 --> 00:51:56.467
pinned in the anti

00:51:56.668 --> 00:51:58.568
JavaScript crowd a lot.

00:51:58.688 --> 00:52:01.731
And I'm not, I'm not anti JavaScript.

00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:03.592
Like the point I try to

00:52:04.711 --> 00:52:07.333
drill in there is I,

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:10.300
that JavaScript's not always

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:11.762
the right answer.

00:52:11.802 --> 00:52:13.463
You don't hire a carpenter

00:52:13.523 --> 00:52:15.204
based on the type of hammer

00:52:15.905 --> 00:52:17.565
that they use.

00:52:17.585 --> 00:52:19.067
You hire them based on their

00:52:19.086 --> 00:52:21.668
ability to build a garage

00:52:21.708 --> 00:52:23.769
or a house or a fence or

00:52:23.789 --> 00:52:24.590
whatever you are.

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:28.253
And I think JavaScript, to me, is a tool.

00:52:28.833 --> 00:52:31.175
And so JavaScript's not

00:52:31.295 --> 00:52:32.416
always the right answer.

00:52:32.795 --> 00:52:34.496
So it's not that I'm against JavaScript.

00:52:34.556 --> 00:52:35.418
I'm against saying

00:52:35.478 --> 00:52:36.878
JavaScript is always the answer.

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:38.612
Yeah, I mean,

00:52:38.632 --> 00:52:41.153
I was definitely in my life

00:52:41.574 --> 00:52:43.494
on the like they're just

00:52:43.594 --> 00:52:44.876
all the program language are tools.

00:52:44.956 --> 00:52:45.396
But, you know,

00:52:45.456 --> 00:52:46.396
I've definitely come more

00:52:46.436 --> 00:52:47.378
around to the fact that

00:52:47.498 --> 00:52:48.358
every single one of these

00:52:48.398 --> 00:52:50.260
tools has some specific

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:53.001
quirks which change the

00:52:53.681 --> 00:52:56.563
utility in the solution

00:52:56.583 --> 00:52:57.304
space that we're in.

00:52:57.804 --> 00:52:59.666
And so it actually is more

00:52:59.706 --> 00:53:01.106
important that we evaluate

00:53:01.148 --> 00:53:03.568
whether or not this tool, this language,

00:53:03.668 --> 00:53:05.150
what it implies, how it works,

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:06.090
who the maintainers are,

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:07.032
what their mentality for

00:53:07.052 --> 00:53:08.972
the long term is for the

00:53:09.012 --> 00:53:10.193
type of solution that we're building.

00:53:10.233 --> 00:53:12.496
And I feel like we're still

00:53:12.536 --> 00:53:13.715
very much stuck in the fact

00:53:13.916 --> 00:53:14.936
of whether or not people

00:53:15.117 --> 00:53:16.739
sort of like the tool itself.

00:53:16.778 --> 00:53:17.579
Like I like hammers,

00:53:17.659 --> 00:53:18.679
I don't like hammers rather

00:53:18.719 --> 00:53:20.360
than the the company that

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:21.762
manufactures the hammers is

00:53:21.802 --> 00:53:22.842
who we should be evaluating.

00:53:22.862 --> 00:53:23.322
Yeah.

00:53:23.523 --> 00:53:23.943
Yeah.

00:53:23.963 --> 00:53:27.326
From from my thoughts on JavaScript,

00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:30.990
from a business standpoint are, you know,

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:32.052
it's probably a little dated now,

00:53:32.072 --> 00:53:32.811
but back in,

00:53:32.891 --> 00:53:34.992
let's just say the mid two thousand tens,

00:53:35.614 --> 00:53:36.934
I can hide if you're going

00:53:36.954 --> 00:53:38.375
to if you're going to write

00:53:38.735 --> 00:53:42.536
PHP and have a website, you know,

00:53:42.556 --> 00:53:43.077
you're going to need to

00:53:43.117 --> 00:53:44.356
have JavaScript in the browser.

00:53:44.516 --> 00:53:44.797
Right.

00:53:44.818 --> 00:53:45.958
That's just you can't run

00:53:45.978 --> 00:53:46.878
PHP in the browser.

00:53:46.898 --> 00:53:47.838
Same thing with Java.

00:53:47.858 --> 00:53:48.978
Same thing with a lot of things.

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.980
So a lot of these developers

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.260
that I was finding had some

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:54.561
amount of JavaScript background.

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:56.452
And I found that you can

00:53:56.532 --> 00:53:58.072
repurpose that little bit

00:53:58.092 --> 00:53:59.233
of JavaScript in the

00:53:59.494 --> 00:54:02.916
browser to run server side

00:54:02.956 --> 00:54:03.757
if you wanted to.

00:54:04.597 --> 00:54:05.159
Much easier.

00:54:05.219 --> 00:54:07.360
So it was more of a cost efficient thing.

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:08.702
I could take a PHP dev

00:54:08.942 --> 00:54:10.882
that's full stack and make

00:54:10.902 --> 00:54:12.384
them into a Node.js dev

00:54:12.443 --> 00:54:14.965
without breaking the bank on that one.

00:54:15.005 --> 00:54:15.606
With that said,

00:54:15.646 --> 00:54:16.708
now with AI being a big thing,

00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:18.869
it would be silly to try

00:54:18.889 --> 00:54:19.809
and use to run neural

00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:20.871
networks in JavaScript.

00:54:20.931 --> 00:54:21.771
I know because I've tried it.

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:23.353
It's probably not a good idea.

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:26.891
So, but no, yeah, you can,

00:54:27.672 --> 00:54:28.472
so you're right.

00:54:28.492 --> 00:54:29.532
You got to pick the right tool for the job,

00:54:29.552 --> 00:54:30.733
but it was strictly on like a,

00:54:31.293 --> 00:54:32.114
who could I, you know,

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:33.315
we can cast a wider net and

00:54:33.355 --> 00:54:34.615
hire people that have

00:54:34.655 --> 00:54:37.097
JavaScript experience and, you know,

00:54:37.117 --> 00:54:38.217
so we can get a wider range

00:54:38.257 --> 00:54:38.936
of people coming in,

00:54:38.956 --> 00:54:39.797
better applicants and

00:54:39.838 --> 00:54:40.717
ideally a better outcome.

00:54:40.737 --> 00:54:42.559
So that was, that's that business,

00:54:43.018 --> 00:54:43.760
you know, numbers,

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:44.579
you got to kind of do that

00:54:44.619 --> 00:54:45.340
calculus as well.

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.521
But again, you're right.

00:54:46.541 --> 00:54:47.701
Not the right tool for AI,

00:54:48.041 --> 00:54:49.422
not the right tool for a lot of things.

00:54:50.646 --> 00:54:50.846
Yeah,

00:54:50.885 --> 00:54:52.206
but it might be the right tool for

00:54:52.226 --> 00:54:53.248
your business because you

00:54:53.288 --> 00:54:55.130
just need a versatile

00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:56.992
programmer who can get shit done.

00:54:57.012 --> 00:54:58.432
Yeah.

00:54:58.452 --> 00:55:00.635
If I'm hiring for the top Python devs,

00:55:00.974 --> 00:55:02.076
a lot harder to figure out

00:55:02.155 --> 00:55:03.097
how to hire those guys than just,

00:55:03.117 --> 00:55:09.722
you know, top Java devs.

00:55:09.762 --> 00:55:10.304
For sure.

00:55:10.983 --> 00:55:12.266
So for people who want to go

00:55:12.326 --> 00:55:15.307
check out Cloud War Games,

00:55:16.168 --> 00:55:17.090
cloudwargames.com.

00:55:19.159 --> 00:55:20.619
Cloudboardgames.com.

00:55:20.639 --> 00:55:21.380
Yep, that's where you find me.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.019
This is the time where I'm

00:55:22.039 --> 00:55:25.942
supposed to kind of tell

00:55:25.961 --> 00:55:26.762
you all the different things.

00:55:26.822 --> 00:55:28.222
I was trying to tee it up to

00:55:28.262 --> 00:55:29.543
let you plug the website,

00:55:29.583 --> 00:55:30.523
but then I just plugged the

00:55:30.543 --> 00:55:31.784
website for you and stole

00:55:31.804 --> 00:55:33.545
the answer out from under you.

00:55:33.804 --> 00:55:34.565
I butchered it.

00:55:35.606 --> 00:55:36.447
For the release of the

00:55:36.487 --> 00:55:37.688
episode on the website,

00:55:37.788 --> 00:55:39.128
adventureindevops.com,

00:55:39.148 --> 00:55:40.250
there'll be a bunch of

00:55:40.269 --> 00:55:41.650
blurbs along with whatever

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:43.853
links you want us to post there.

00:55:43.893 --> 00:55:44.492
So if you want to just

00:55:44.532 --> 00:55:46.474
respond to us after the podcast,

00:55:47.074 --> 00:55:47.876
all of the things that

00:55:47.896 --> 00:55:49.416
we've talked about in this episode,

00:55:49.677 --> 00:55:50.577
for anyone who's interested,

00:55:50.637 --> 00:55:51.478
we'll all be listed there.

00:55:51.498 --> 00:55:51.679
Sure.

00:55:51.778 --> 00:55:53.260
Okay.

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:53.860
Well, yes,

00:55:54.059 --> 00:55:55.862
cloudwargames.com is where you

00:55:55.882 --> 00:55:56.541
can find that.

00:55:56.702 --> 00:55:57.842
Schematical.com,

00:55:57.862 --> 00:55:58.864
that's the word schematic

00:55:58.923 --> 00:55:59.744
with AL at the end,

00:56:00.164 --> 00:56:02.065
is where you can find most of my writing,

00:56:02.085 --> 00:56:02.867
schematical.com.

00:56:03.371 --> 00:56:04.070
And soon,

00:56:04.572 --> 00:56:05.492
I haven't announced this publicly.

00:56:05.512 --> 00:56:06.833
This is the first time I'm announcing it.

00:56:07.032 --> 00:56:07.853
I actually just spent the

00:56:07.873 --> 00:56:08.574
last three months of my

00:56:08.614 --> 00:56:09.594
life building a video

00:56:09.634 --> 00:56:11.394
course for O'Reilly's,

00:56:11.414 --> 00:56:12.235
the publishing company.

00:56:12.275 --> 00:56:15.217
No, it's an on-demand video course.

00:56:15.237 --> 00:56:16.998
They wanted me to say on-demand.

00:56:17.137 --> 00:56:18.657
On-demand video course for

00:56:18.677 --> 00:56:19.559
O'Reilly Publishing.

00:56:19.878 --> 00:56:21.960
And so that will be live, hopefully,

00:56:22.019 --> 00:56:23.561
by the next two weeks or so,

00:56:23.581 --> 00:56:24.840
maybe by the time this comes out.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.942
So if you want to learn Zero

00:56:26.961 --> 00:56:28.282
to Hero on AWS Security and

00:56:28.382 --> 00:56:30.184
Animated Guide to Security in the Cloud,

00:56:31.425 --> 00:56:32.065
that will be there.

00:56:32.893 --> 00:56:34.215
Um, so if I'm over-plugging this,

00:56:34.255 --> 00:56:36.554
feel free to cut it, but, uh,

00:56:36.655 --> 00:56:37.996
I'm super interested in this.

00:56:38.016 --> 00:56:39.016
So now this is a,

00:56:39.076 --> 00:56:42.637
an animated course on AWS security.

00:56:42.657 --> 00:56:43.297
Yes.

00:56:43.836 --> 00:56:44.757
Yes, it is.

00:56:44.777 --> 00:56:45.637
Actually, if you, if you want,

00:56:45.677 --> 00:56:47.358
I've got a diagram here that I queued up.

00:56:47.458 --> 00:56:48.259
Okay.

00:56:48.278 --> 00:56:49.478
We can cut this if you want, but, uh,

00:56:50.099 --> 00:56:51.260
if you guys want, I'm actually,

00:56:51.679 --> 00:56:53.760
we can play a micro round

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:59.621
of cloud war games right now.

00:56:59.822 --> 00:57:00.483
Let's do it.

00:57:00.722 --> 00:57:01.802
Can I present here?

00:57:02.184 --> 00:57:07.309
share screen share screen so

00:57:07.329 --> 00:57:09.710
this right here you guys

00:57:09.751 --> 00:57:11.291
tell me if you could see it

00:57:13.032 --> 00:57:14.193
we can now anyone listening

00:57:14.213 --> 00:57:15.215
to the podcast can't so I'm

00:57:15.235 --> 00:57:16.074
going to narrate it for

00:57:16.114 --> 00:57:19.938
them okay here we go all

00:57:19.958 --> 00:57:21.398
right we have our

00:57:21.418 --> 00:57:22.480
infrastructure here this is

00:57:22.559 --> 00:57:24.822
a network map all right and

00:57:24.862 --> 00:57:25.922
we've got a user right here

00:57:25.963 --> 00:57:26.643
so this I'm going to go as

00:57:26.663 --> 00:57:27.744
fast as I can because I know we're

00:57:28.313 --> 00:57:29.635
I want to be respectful of your time,

00:57:29.655 --> 00:57:30.715
but a request come in,

00:57:31.036 --> 00:57:32.556
hits the application load balancer,

00:57:32.657 --> 00:57:34.498
hits the application server,

00:57:34.978 --> 00:57:36.860
then your shopping cart,

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.541
so I should set the tone,

00:57:38.561 --> 00:57:39.282
e-commerce store.

00:57:39.382 --> 00:57:40.682
You're running an e-commerce store here.

00:57:40.983 --> 00:57:42.443
The shopping cart's stored in Redis.

00:57:42.684 --> 00:57:43.525
So they say, hey,

00:57:43.565 --> 00:57:45.847
I want to buy this thing.

00:57:45.887 --> 00:57:46.907
It goes into Redis,

00:57:48.027 --> 00:57:49.809
goes back to the application layer,

00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:52.630
and now they've added it to their cart.

00:57:55.632 --> 00:57:56.014
And...

00:57:57.007 --> 00:57:58.007
Let's just say that they

00:57:58.068 --> 00:57:59.489
actually go to make a purchase.

00:58:00.028 --> 00:58:01.068
It's the application server.

00:58:01.088 --> 00:58:02.610
We're doing event-driven architecture.

00:58:02.929 --> 00:58:04.309
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:05.250
maybe it's not the right one.

00:58:05.289 --> 00:58:06.351
All right,

00:58:06.371 --> 00:58:06.931
we're gonna forget about the

00:58:06.951 --> 00:58:07.570
animation for now.

00:58:07.751 --> 00:58:08.610
Event-driven architecture

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:09.452
pumped into Kinesis.

00:58:09.512 --> 00:58:10.552
That updates the database

00:58:10.572 --> 00:58:11.652
saying a purchase was made.

00:58:11.672 --> 00:58:12.572
It updates the inventory

00:58:12.592 --> 00:58:13.512
management software.

00:58:13.552 --> 00:58:15.592
It updates the product

00:58:15.632 --> 00:58:16.773
worker which charges them

00:58:17.134 --> 00:58:17.934
and updates the mail

00:58:17.954 --> 00:58:19.514
service and all that stuff there.

00:58:19.594 --> 00:58:19.773
All right,

00:58:19.813 --> 00:58:21.635
I'm getting to the details here.

00:58:21.675 --> 00:58:22.454
Here's the scenario, okay?

00:58:23.695 --> 00:58:25.096
Customer service comes to you and says,

00:58:26.233 --> 00:58:27.655
We are getting reports that

00:58:27.695 --> 00:58:31.599
people are missing stuff in their cart.

00:58:31.619 --> 00:58:32.699
They're adding stuff to

00:58:32.719 --> 00:58:33.641
their cart and all of a

00:58:33.661 --> 00:58:34.641
sudden when they go to checkout,

00:58:34.681 --> 00:58:35.302
it's not there.

00:58:35.362 --> 00:58:36.744
They go to another page, it's not there.

00:58:37.304 --> 00:58:40.487
All right, what do we do?

00:58:40.527 --> 00:58:42.409
So I'm going to highlight this real quick.

00:58:42.449 --> 00:58:44.449
We're looking at an animated

00:58:44.489 --> 00:58:47.793
diagram of an AWS environment, right?

00:58:47.873 --> 00:58:48.753
And is this part of the

00:58:48.773 --> 00:58:50.356
Cloud Wars games interface?

00:58:50.998 --> 00:58:51.458
It will be.

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:52.739
It's not actually,

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:53.621
this is running locally

00:58:53.661 --> 00:58:54.302
right now because I've

00:58:54.322 --> 00:58:56.242
never bothered to put it on a website,

00:58:56.262 --> 00:58:58.244
but it'll be up eventually.

00:58:58.625 --> 00:59:02.347
I'll use it locally if I have to for now.

00:59:02.387 --> 00:59:02.708
Right on.

00:59:03.467 --> 00:59:03.648
Okay,

00:59:03.708 --> 00:59:05.909
so there's stuff missing from their cart.

00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:10.293
I'm assuming that the cart

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:12.155
is persisted somewhere in

00:59:12.195 --> 00:59:13.096
some data store somewhere?

00:59:14.195 --> 00:59:14.936
That is correct.

00:59:15.197 --> 00:59:17.478
It is in Redis.

00:59:18.547 --> 00:59:18.887
Right on.

00:59:19.628 --> 00:59:21.530
So do we have a way to check

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:23.070
the logs on Redis or check

00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:24.893
the whatever is writing logs to Redis?

00:59:25.773 --> 00:59:27.394
It's running on ElastiCache.

00:59:27.574 --> 00:59:30.277
ElastiCache does have events.

00:59:31.097 --> 00:59:32.458
I don't know if you can get

00:59:32.478 --> 00:59:33.539
directly to the logs there,

00:59:33.559 --> 00:59:35.882
but you can log into Redis

00:59:36.382 --> 00:59:38.344
and run some stuff.

00:59:38.364 --> 00:59:39.764
You've got metrics too.

00:59:39.784 --> 00:59:40.666
Don't forget you do have

00:59:40.686 --> 00:59:41.547
CloudWatch metrics.

00:59:44.958 --> 00:59:46.079
I guess the first question is like,

00:59:46.259 --> 00:59:47.559
is the data in the database

00:59:47.579 --> 00:59:48.320
where it's supposed to be?

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.161
If we're using Redis,

00:59:49.202 --> 00:59:50.802
like Redis Commander or

00:59:50.822 --> 00:59:52.063
something to tell us

00:59:52.123 --> 00:59:53.085
whether or not the items

00:59:53.125 --> 00:59:55.746
are actually in the shopping cart store.

00:59:55.766 --> 00:59:56.106
Yeah.

00:59:56.146 --> 00:59:58.288
So you go in there, you've got,

00:59:58.668 --> 00:59:59.568
let's call it a hundred

00:59:59.588 --> 01:00:02.371
thousand keys and you look at it,

01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:03.331
there is data in there.

01:00:03.652 --> 01:00:04.032
You can,

01:00:05.614 --> 01:00:07.114
I wouldn't do this step for you normally,

01:00:07.135 --> 01:00:07.996
but I'm going to do it just

01:00:08.016 --> 01:00:09.137
because I'm going to speed things along.

01:00:09.577 --> 01:00:10.938
You go in there and you try

01:00:10.958 --> 01:00:11.818
and add things to your cart.

01:00:11.838 --> 01:00:12.139
Of course,

01:00:19.005 --> 01:00:20.206
Does the cart for the

01:00:20.706 --> 01:00:21.827
customer who's complaining,

01:00:22.606 --> 01:00:23.407
are you able to have a

01:00:23.467 --> 01:00:24.527
session for that that you

01:00:24.547 --> 01:00:25.469
can track to check to see

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:26.929
if there are actual items

01:00:26.969 --> 01:00:28.090
for that session in the cart?

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:29.710
So this is where I want to

01:00:29.731 --> 01:00:30.692
go like a five-sided die.

01:00:30.711 --> 01:00:31.092
Do you have a

01:00:31.132 --> 01:00:32.413
technical-minded customer or not?

01:00:32.432 --> 01:00:33.753
Okay, you just rolled.

01:00:33.773 --> 01:00:34.974
Do you have a technical-minded customer?

01:00:35.014 --> 01:00:35.695
They can open up their

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:37.036
browser and copy the cookie

01:00:37.315 --> 01:00:38.777
for the session and send it to you.

01:00:39.496 --> 01:00:40.898
And so, yes, you have their session.

01:00:42.114 --> 01:00:42.333
I mean,

01:00:42.434 --> 01:00:43.474
I always assume they're not a

01:00:43.514 --> 01:00:44.215
technical customer.

01:00:44.275 --> 01:00:45.275
And so you try to get them

01:00:45.436 --> 01:00:47.117
to purchase some fake item

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:48.597
in the cart that only,

01:00:48.838 --> 01:00:50.599
only their session will,

01:00:50.918 --> 01:00:54.260
will have access to a magic URL.

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:54.541
Right.

01:00:54.802 --> 01:00:55.802
That allows you to attract it.

01:00:55.842 --> 01:00:55.942
Yeah.

01:00:55.981 --> 01:00:56.163
Yeah.

01:00:56.182 --> 01:00:56.463
I love that.

01:00:56.543 --> 01:00:58.324
Yeah.

01:00:58.724 --> 01:00:59.585
I was just being nice

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:00.844
because we don't want to be

01:01:00.885 --> 01:01:01.925
for the sake of time, but yes,

01:01:02.186 --> 01:01:02.746
I love that solution.

01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:04.226
This is the type of solution, but I didn't,

01:01:04.246 --> 01:01:05.068
I wouldn't have thought of that.

01:01:05.487 --> 01:01:06.329
I would have thought this is

01:01:06.369 --> 01:01:07.248
the type of stuff you can

01:01:07.268 --> 01:01:08.269
get with these type of games.

01:01:08.751 --> 01:01:08.871
Well,

01:01:09.072 --> 01:01:10.733
we got to debug this stuff for real

01:01:10.753 --> 01:01:11.652
all the time at our company.

01:01:11.672 --> 01:01:12.813
I mean, we're not e-commerce,

01:01:12.853 --> 01:01:16.355
but we do login and access control.

01:01:16.454 --> 01:01:18.175
And so it's always a point of contention,

01:01:18.195 --> 01:01:19.396
like why didn't this user

01:01:19.456 --> 01:01:20.416
have access to this

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:22.498
resource at this particular moment?

01:01:22.878 --> 01:01:24.119
And so figuring that out

01:01:24.159 --> 01:01:25.079
requires a bunch of things.

01:01:25.099 --> 01:01:27.320
So we have ways to give our

01:01:27.701 --> 01:01:29.061
customers information that

01:01:29.081 --> 01:01:30.521
they can inject into their environment

01:01:31.222 --> 01:01:32.262
when they're performing the

01:01:32.302 --> 01:01:33.382
sort of investigation that

01:01:33.443 --> 01:01:34.802
we can see on our side so

01:01:34.822 --> 01:01:35.902
that we can highlight

01:01:35.922 --> 01:01:38.063
exactly which traces make sense.

01:01:38.864 --> 01:01:39.503
Otherwise, you know,

01:01:39.623 --> 01:01:40.523
you're looking at all of

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:41.784
the data for every customer

01:01:42.403 --> 01:01:43.344
in order to narrow that down.

01:01:43.965 --> 01:01:44.144
Yeah.

01:01:44.204 --> 01:01:44.704
So, I mean,

01:01:44.885 --> 01:01:46.945
you said technical customer or

01:01:47.244 --> 01:01:48.166
some magic solution.

01:01:48.306 --> 01:01:49.846
And are we getting their

01:01:49.905 --> 01:01:50.746
items in the cart or is

01:01:50.786 --> 01:01:51.726
their session busted?

01:01:52.286 --> 01:01:53.266
You check the session

01:01:53.367 --> 01:01:56.387
against the red state of

01:01:56.407 --> 01:01:57.188
the session key there.

01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:58.228
Items are gone.

01:01:59.628 --> 01:02:00.427
Not there.

01:02:00.487 --> 01:02:01.068
There's nothing there.

01:02:01.088 --> 01:02:01.969
There's nothing for that key.

01:02:01.989 --> 01:02:05.431
Key's gone.

01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:07.311
So you mentioned ElastiCache.

01:02:07.612 --> 01:02:08.492
I'm assuming that wasn't

01:02:08.512 --> 01:02:09.992
just randomly throwing out words.

01:02:10.072 --> 01:02:12.034
Where's that at in this pipeline?

01:02:12.054 --> 01:02:15.215
Redis running on AWS is ElastiCache.

01:02:15.275 --> 01:02:16.155
I just don't have.

01:02:16.615 --> 01:02:17.856
ElastiCache is a service

01:02:17.896 --> 01:02:19.338
that runs value key stores.

01:02:19.998 --> 01:02:20.217
Okay.

01:02:20.277 --> 01:02:21.358
I got a couple different ones,

01:02:21.418 --> 01:02:22.458
but I picked Redis.

01:02:22.498 --> 01:02:23.820
It's my go-to.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.159
Gotcha.

01:02:24.519 --> 01:02:24.860
Understood.

01:02:27.474 --> 01:02:29.139
So they put something through the browser,

01:02:29.219 --> 01:02:30.561
in the cart, never made it up,

01:02:30.882 --> 01:02:32.567
never made it into Redis.

01:02:33.389 --> 01:02:34.911
Who's responsible for sending it to Redis?

01:02:34.931 --> 01:02:37.699
To clarify, so just

01:02:38.945 --> 01:02:39.867
Again, I'm giving you way too much here.

01:02:39.887 --> 01:02:40.987
I never said it didn't make

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:42.369
it into Redis in the first place,

01:02:42.389 --> 01:02:42.889
just to be clear.

01:02:42.949 --> 01:02:45.670
Or it just got deleted instantaneously.

01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:47.811
By the time it gets to the cart,

01:02:47.972 --> 01:02:49.052
by the time you look at it,

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:50.072
it's no longer there.

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:51.514
So there could be some sort

01:02:51.574 --> 01:02:53.295
of TTL on the items that

01:02:53.315 --> 01:02:54.695
are going into the cart or

01:02:54.735 --> 01:02:55.817
some other process that's

01:02:55.876 --> 01:02:56.938
eliminating them from Redis.

01:02:57.077 --> 01:02:57.898
Or, of course,

01:02:57.938 --> 01:03:01.079
not getting there in the first place.

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:01.820
Yeah.

01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:02.721
So just to speed us along,

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:03.442
I'm going to drop what I

01:03:03.461 --> 01:03:04.181
would give as a hint.

01:03:05.867 --> 01:03:08.329
that you do have cloud watch logs for, uh,

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:09.210
for Reddit.

01:03:09.251 --> 01:03:11.331
So you could ask me what they are saying.

01:03:12.672 --> 01:03:14.114
Well, what are the logs saying?

01:03:15.195 --> 01:03:17.597
So number of items is pretty

01:03:17.677 --> 01:03:19.498
number of items went up, but flatlines.

01:03:20.579 --> 01:03:20.759
Okay.

01:03:20.778 --> 01:03:21.980
CPU usage is fine.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.561
Um,

01:03:23.621 --> 01:03:26.182
number of evictions is up quite a bit

01:03:26.463 --> 01:03:27.003
evictions.

01:03:27.923 --> 01:03:30.846
Oh, so they got, they got evicted.

01:03:31.126 --> 01:03:31.246
Um,

01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:36.054
Yep.

01:03:36.474 --> 01:03:37.373
And then I guess the usable

01:03:37.414 --> 01:03:38.255
memory dropped.

01:03:38.275 --> 01:03:41.896
So again, I'm going to simulate this.

01:03:42.376 --> 01:03:44.478
I wasted one of my real juicy ones,

01:03:44.498 --> 01:03:45.778
but I guess it's probably good here.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.621
So yeah, evictions are up.

01:03:49.041 --> 01:03:50.862
So what's the solution there?

01:03:52.483 --> 01:03:53.824
So I don't use Redis a whole lot.

01:03:53.864 --> 01:03:56.146
So obviously,

01:03:57.106 --> 01:03:59.067
it seems like Redis evicted

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:00.347
for some reason because it

01:04:00.387 --> 01:04:01.969
either has like a max

01:04:02.009 --> 01:04:03.210
number of key values that

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:04.951
it can store or it ran out of space.

01:04:06.067 --> 01:04:07.148
Yep, that is correct.

01:04:07.168 --> 01:04:08.528
It just runs out of data.

01:04:08.588 --> 01:04:09.849
You can set eviction policies,

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:10.570
but in this case,

01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:12.052
I think the default is to

01:04:12.072 --> 01:04:13.512
just start evicting the older ones.

01:04:13.972 --> 01:04:16.795
And so that's what happens is they,

01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:17.496
it filled up.

01:04:17.596 --> 01:04:19.277
Maybe it was a big shopping day, you know,

01:04:19.297 --> 01:04:20.657
and you didn't expect this much,

01:04:21.518 --> 01:04:22.280
this many people to put

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:22.980
stuff in the cart.

01:04:23.039 --> 01:04:24.300
And so it filled up more.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.282
I mean, it's, again,

01:04:26.382 --> 01:04:27.063
I'm going to just kind of

01:04:27.083 --> 01:04:27.664
speed through this,

01:04:27.704 --> 01:04:30.786
but possibly you could look

01:04:30.846 --> 01:04:32.427
at it and some change made

01:04:32.467 --> 01:04:34.068
the payload of each key

01:04:40.905 --> 01:04:41.726
Instead of just the product

01:04:41.806 --> 01:04:43.047
IDs and quantities,

01:04:43.086 --> 01:04:45.628
we're caching the metadata

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:46.329
and the products.

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.889
For some reason,

01:04:46.909 --> 01:04:47.510
somebody accidentally

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.072
messed up and put that in there.

01:04:49.632 --> 01:04:50.753
And now it's just bloated.

01:04:50.793 --> 01:04:52.795
So the fix would – I'll let

01:04:52.875 --> 01:04:54.757
you guys present the fix if

01:04:54.777 --> 01:04:55.677
you guys have anything there.

01:04:55.757 --> 01:04:59.340
I know I've told you the problem.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.961
I think the emergency fix is

01:05:01.021 --> 01:05:02.222
increase the size of Redis

01:05:02.282 --> 01:05:04.244
so that we – That's

01:05:04.284 --> 01:05:05.065
probably what I would do.

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:06.246
And then the long-term fix

01:05:06.286 --> 01:05:07.708
would be to fix the bug

01:05:07.728 --> 01:05:09.289
that had them catch all that stuff.

01:05:09.702 --> 01:05:10.521
Actually happened once.

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:11.322
Actually happened.

01:05:11.342 --> 01:05:13.003
They had to cache a bunch of

01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:15.164
HTML in there that was like, I'm like,

01:05:15.384 --> 01:05:17.485
this is a JSON object with HTML in it.

01:05:17.545 --> 01:05:19.945
Like, what are you doing here?

01:05:19.985 --> 01:05:21.585
Stop caching that stuff in this thing.

01:05:21.606 --> 01:05:22.927
But it happened.

01:05:22.967 --> 01:05:23.806
So, yeah.

01:05:23.847 --> 01:05:24.387
All right.

01:05:24.407 --> 01:05:25.108
Congratulations.

01:05:26.135 --> 01:05:28.235
action report and so on and so forth.

01:05:28.255 --> 01:05:31.038
So, yeah, I mean, this is great.

01:05:31.398 --> 01:05:32.557
I'm actually sort of curious

01:05:32.818 --> 01:05:33.998
on the scenario is,

01:05:34.478 --> 01:05:35.380
is using Redis as a

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.900
temporary store for the cart,

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:40.161
a common pattern in e-commerce stores.

01:05:40.822 --> 01:05:41.822
When at early stage.

01:05:41.842 --> 01:05:42.443
Yeah.

01:05:42.463 --> 01:05:44.784
So a lot of my clients, you know,

01:05:44.804 --> 01:05:45.465
I love them to death

01:05:45.545 --> 01:05:47.626
clients understand they, you know, they,

01:05:47.646 --> 01:05:48.487
they start off with

01:05:48.507 --> 01:05:49.206
something simple like

01:05:49.226 --> 01:05:50.047
WordPress and then they

01:05:50.068 --> 01:05:51.467
start slapping more things in there.

01:05:51.487 --> 01:05:52.168
Not the way I would do it,

01:05:53.047 --> 01:05:53.929
Now, the way I would do it is, I mean,

01:05:53.969 --> 01:05:55.050
there's a lot of data you

01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:56.112
can extract from carts.

01:05:56.132 --> 01:05:57.172
It's not ephemeral data.

01:05:57.193 --> 01:05:59.496
You'd want to know who's adding what, when,

01:05:59.536 --> 01:05:59.797
where.

01:05:59.817 --> 01:06:01.038
You can send a reminder, emails,

01:06:01.077 --> 01:06:01.498
all that stuff.

01:06:01.539 --> 01:06:05.184
But with devs,

01:06:05.204 --> 01:06:06.065
a lot of times it's just

01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:07.086
stuff everything in the

01:06:07.126 --> 01:06:08.628
session and then pray.

01:06:09.085 --> 01:06:10.085
Yeah, I mean,

01:06:10.885 --> 01:06:13.168
I get I get the perspective

01:06:13.307 --> 01:06:15.329
of knowing that it's temporary data.

01:06:15.469 --> 01:06:16.391
It's not the order hasn't

01:06:16.411 --> 01:06:17.251
been created yet.

01:06:17.291 --> 01:06:18.251
So storing it in a data

01:06:18.271 --> 01:06:19.813
store that may not be persistent.

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:20.833
I also get the idea that

01:06:20.853 --> 01:06:22.215
people believe that Redis

01:06:22.235 --> 01:06:24.137
is this non ephemeral data

01:06:24.177 --> 01:06:24.996
store and you know,

01:06:25.016 --> 01:06:25.878
go ahead and use it as your

01:06:25.918 --> 01:06:26.898
source of truth database.

01:06:27.278 --> 01:06:29.581
But in the mature businesses, as you said,

01:06:30.442 --> 01:06:31.061
you actually don't even

01:06:31.081 --> 01:06:32.302
want to throw away that session data.

01:06:32.342 --> 01:06:33.143
As soon as you have it,

01:06:33.164 --> 01:06:34.123
you might as well be

01:06:34.184 --> 01:06:35.164
persisting it for

01:06:35.945 --> 01:06:37.867
permanency so that you can evaluate,

01:06:37.967 --> 01:06:39.128
why didn't that convert to

01:06:39.148 --> 01:06:40.409
an actual order?

01:06:40.489 --> 01:06:41.630
Why didn't that person come back?

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:43.050
And then once they do

01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:46.333
actually click buy and

01:06:46.813 --> 01:06:47.735
payment gets processed,

01:06:47.835 --> 01:06:48.695
you don't need to convert

01:06:48.735 --> 01:06:50.597
it from your temporary data

01:06:50.637 --> 01:06:52.518
store into a permanent one.

01:06:52.538 --> 01:06:53.639
You already have it there.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.661
The payment is sort of separate.

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:58.260
I'm actually trying to get

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.280
you to exactly what you're

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.641
describing for the video I

01:07:01.661 --> 01:07:03.661
did on Amazon Glue and

01:07:04.681 --> 01:07:07.202
putting that data in a

01:07:07.262 --> 01:07:08.282
long-term cold source,

01:07:08.501 --> 01:07:09.222
basically telling people

01:07:09.242 --> 01:07:10.422
the difference between a source of truth,

01:07:10.681 --> 01:07:14.402
ephemeral, and long-term red shifter,

01:07:14.742 --> 01:07:16.842
big data analytics tools, data warehouse,

01:07:16.882 --> 01:07:18.784
data lake type situation.

01:07:19.724 --> 01:07:21.304
This is one of your videos

01:07:21.324 --> 01:07:24.364
that's going on on demand on O'Reilly?

01:07:25.445 --> 01:07:26.284
No, that's my YouTube

01:07:33.001 --> 01:07:33.661
I'm going to stop sharing

01:07:33.681 --> 01:07:39.903
since I didn't prepare for that one.

01:07:39.983 --> 01:07:40.985
Will's gone dark for me.

01:07:41.025 --> 01:07:42.505
He's got no camera on.

01:07:42.585 --> 01:07:44.186
He's hiding from the public.

01:07:44.206 --> 01:07:45.527
Oh, and anonymous.

01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:47.387
Yeah.

01:07:47.668 --> 01:07:47.847
I mean,

01:07:47.947 --> 01:07:49.949
I think this is a good point to

01:07:50.208 --> 01:07:51.409
maybe wrap up the episode,

01:07:51.889 --> 01:07:52.510
unless there's anything,

01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:54.090
last words you want to

01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:56.010
share about Cloud WarGames

01:07:56.251 --> 01:07:58.132
or your consultancy.

01:07:58.532 --> 01:07:58.733
No,

01:07:59.092 --> 01:08:00.492
I want to thank you both for being the

01:08:00.572 --> 01:08:01.733
first participants

01:08:05.244 --> 01:08:07.005
It's somewhat an unofficial capacity there,

01:08:07.025 --> 01:08:08.226
but thank you both for

01:08:08.606 --> 01:08:10.126
being the first participants.

01:08:10.206 --> 01:08:11.947
I know we kind of played a

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:12.688
micro around there,

01:08:12.708 --> 01:08:15.228
but I invite you once I get

01:08:15.248 --> 01:08:16.189
this thing moving,

01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:17.809
I'd invite you guys to come

01:08:17.868 --> 01:08:18.550
and participate.

01:08:18.609 --> 01:08:20.050
And if you guys are game,

01:08:20.069 --> 01:08:22.350
maybe I come back and run a

01:08:22.411 --> 01:08:24.110
full length game with you

01:08:24.131 --> 01:08:25.431
guys or something of that nature.

01:08:25.452 --> 01:08:26.652
So it's just throwing that

01:08:26.671 --> 01:08:27.452
out there if you're interested.

01:08:27.912 --> 01:08:29.573
That'd be a blast and would

01:08:29.592 --> 01:08:31.673
love to have you back on at any time.

01:08:33.621 --> 01:08:34.020
For that,

01:08:34.381 --> 01:08:35.582
and there's a bunch of other

01:08:35.743 --> 01:08:37.524
topics we like touched on

01:08:37.564 --> 01:08:38.425
here that I think would be

01:08:38.465 --> 01:08:39.746
cool to dig deeper on.

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:42.548
Yeah, for sure.

01:08:42.988 --> 01:08:43.269
I'm all in.

01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:44.050
It would be my pleasure.

01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:45.570
You let me know when and I'll, you know,

01:08:45.671 --> 01:08:47.893
another guest drops out, come find me.

01:08:49.835 --> 01:08:50.855
We'll do.

01:08:50.876 --> 01:08:52.676
With that, should we move on to picks,

01:08:52.697 --> 01:08:52.938
Will?

01:08:53.417 --> 01:08:53.858
We should.

01:08:53.978 --> 01:08:56.720
Ah, man.

01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:57.681
Words are hard.

01:08:57.721 --> 01:08:58.641
Yeah, right?

01:08:59.554 --> 01:09:00.255
Just like to take this

01:09:00.295 --> 01:09:01.315
opportunity to point out to

01:09:01.355 --> 01:09:02.777
everyone that English is my

01:09:02.817 --> 01:09:04.578
native language and I still screw it up.

01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:11.725
You should see me editing my videos.

01:09:11.744 --> 01:09:12.345
A lot of swearing.

01:09:12.365 --> 01:09:12.666
For sure.

01:09:13.006 --> 01:09:14.167
I used to do quite a few

01:09:15.908 --> 01:09:17.289
YouTube videos and did some

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:19.792
video courses and stuff.

01:09:21.015 --> 01:09:21.936
And my wife would always

01:09:21.976 --> 01:09:23.097
give me a hard time.

01:09:23.118 --> 01:09:23.738
She would say,

01:09:24.238 --> 01:09:26.280
I can always tell how it's

01:09:26.341 --> 01:09:27.921
going by how many cuss

01:09:27.942 --> 01:09:29.122
words I can hear coming out

01:09:29.143 --> 01:09:30.123
of your office.

01:09:32.445 --> 01:09:33.246
Then at one point I made

01:09:33.286 --> 01:09:34.167
like a blooper reel where I

01:09:34.186 --> 01:09:35.108
just took all the cuss

01:09:35.127 --> 01:09:36.909
words that I cut out of all my videos.

01:09:37.409 --> 01:09:38.451
And it was like an eight

01:09:38.490 --> 01:09:40.292
minute stream of just some

01:09:40.311 --> 01:09:41.252
of the most offensive

01:09:41.313 --> 01:09:43.154
language that has ever been recorded.

01:09:43.175 --> 01:09:43.314
Yeah.

01:09:43.335 --> 01:09:47.057
All right.

01:09:47.137 --> 01:09:48.019
Anyway, on to pics.

01:09:50.966 --> 01:09:51.627
Warren, you brought it up,

01:09:51.646 --> 01:09:52.988
so I'll go first.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.470
A couple of weeks ago,

01:09:55.609 --> 01:09:57.270
I picked Kunk on Earth,

01:09:57.371 --> 01:09:58.511
the Netflix special.

01:09:59.052 --> 01:10:02.395
I think that was when we had AJ Funk on.

01:10:02.895 --> 01:10:05.037
He said that there was a new

01:10:05.136 --> 01:10:07.998
one called Kunk on Life.

01:10:08.139 --> 01:10:08.899
I watched that,

01:10:09.079 --> 01:10:10.661
and I thought Kunk on Earth

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.362
was so great that there

01:10:12.381 --> 01:10:14.863
would be no way a follow-up

01:10:14.904 --> 01:10:16.984
to it could be as entertaining as

01:10:17.596 --> 01:10:18.737
And I'm happy to tell you

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:21.597
that I was wrong on so many levels.

01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:23.337
So Kunk on Life,

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:25.939
go check that out on Netflix.

01:10:27.819 --> 01:10:29.340
Just the sense of humor

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:30.819
there and the dryness of

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.001
that sense of humor had me

01:10:33.041 --> 01:10:35.461
just rolling on the floor laughing.

01:10:35.701 --> 01:10:36.981
Just absolutely amazing.

01:10:37.502 --> 01:10:38.641
And they accidentally made

01:10:38.702 --> 01:10:40.502
it educational as well.

01:10:40.722 --> 01:10:42.243
So go check that out.

01:10:45.572 --> 01:10:45.912
Well,

01:10:46.073 --> 01:10:47.457
I definitely will because I liked all

01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:50.063
of the other series by Philomena.

01:10:50.545 --> 01:10:50.864
Yeah.

01:10:51.126 --> 01:10:52.930
I guess that's her stage

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:55.076
name and not the actress's name.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:00.101
Mine is... I guess I also have a show.

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:03.225
I read the books,

01:11:03.326 --> 01:11:07.069
Three-Body Problem by Leo Tsichin.

01:11:07.770 --> 01:11:08.951
This is actually one of the

01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.992
scenarios where I actually

01:11:10.011 --> 01:11:10.972
like the series better.

01:11:11.073 --> 01:11:11.734
I think the series is

01:11:11.833 --> 01:11:12.734
absolutely fantastic.

01:11:14.195 --> 01:11:14.976
Some of the books are good,

01:11:15.436 --> 01:11:16.078
but the series...

01:11:17.238 --> 01:11:18.380
absolutely really well done

01:11:18.661 --> 01:11:19.721
uh I really look forward to

01:11:19.761 --> 01:11:22.604
the follow-up seasons um if

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:23.506
you haven't seen it or read

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:24.286
the books I highly

01:11:24.345 --> 01:11:25.667
recommend there's a lot of

01:11:25.707 --> 01:11:27.310
good philosophical ideas

01:11:27.329 --> 01:11:29.311
that are brought up okay

01:11:29.811 --> 01:11:30.712
give me the high level of

01:11:30.733 --> 01:11:32.215
what it's about because I'm

01:11:32.234 --> 01:11:33.074
just assuming from the

01:11:33.114 --> 01:11:34.377
title three body problem

01:11:34.396 --> 01:11:35.398
this is how to get away

01:11:35.417 --> 01:11:38.121
with murdering someone but I may be wrong

01:11:39.101 --> 01:11:39.221
No,

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:40.863
it actually has to do with the

01:11:41.002 --> 01:11:43.524
unsolvability of finding

01:11:43.704 --> 01:11:44.824
out without the initial

01:11:44.864 --> 01:11:47.367
conditions what the path

01:11:47.766 --> 01:11:49.507
and orientation of a solar

01:11:49.547 --> 01:11:51.908
system with three masses in it is.

01:11:51.929 --> 01:11:52.069
Ah, okay.

01:11:52.109 --> 01:11:54.511
That's not going to be as

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:55.411
useful to me as I thought

01:11:55.451 --> 01:11:56.112
it was at first.

01:11:57.692 --> 01:12:02.613
Without spoiling really that much,

01:12:03.233 --> 01:12:04.613
one of the very close solar

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:08.033
systems in our galaxy in

01:12:08.054 --> 01:12:10.073
the Milky Way to our solar

01:12:10.094 --> 01:12:15.494
system is one with three stars in it.

01:12:15.555 --> 01:12:18.015
It's science fiction, really good,

01:12:18.296 --> 01:12:19.435
philosophical dilemmas,

01:12:20.695 --> 01:12:22.036
absolutely fantastic, well done.

01:12:23.237 --> 01:12:24.936
Is that the Alpha Centauri system?

01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.792
That you're referring to?

01:12:26.931 --> 01:12:27.171
Yeah.

01:12:27.412 --> 01:12:27.511
Yeah.

01:12:27.551 --> 01:12:28.252
Because they originally

01:12:28.273 --> 01:12:29.434
thought it was one star and

01:12:29.453 --> 01:12:30.555
then found out that it was

01:12:31.595 --> 01:12:33.497
two binary stars in orbit

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.137
with another star close by, I think.

01:12:35.439 --> 01:12:35.679
Yeah.

01:12:35.979 --> 01:12:36.179
Yeah.

01:12:36.439 --> 01:12:38.820
Yeah.

01:12:38.881 --> 01:12:40.082
It's four light years away.

01:12:41.162 --> 01:12:41.804
Right.

01:12:41.823 --> 01:12:42.663
Just across the street.

01:12:43.284 --> 01:12:43.484
Yeah.

01:12:44.546 --> 01:12:45.846
So, Matt, what do you got for us?

01:12:45.867 --> 01:12:45.947
Yes.

01:12:47.853 --> 01:12:49.413
you got all this Einstein stuff.

01:12:49.474 --> 01:12:50.914
I did not come prepared for that.

01:12:50.975 --> 01:12:54.796
I got the comic book,

01:12:54.817 --> 01:12:57.797
Scott Pilgrim versus the world.

01:12:57.939 --> 01:12:58.238
Nice.

01:12:58.559 --> 01:12:59.338
Yeah.

01:12:59.378 --> 01:13:00.720
They do a lot of pixel art

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.640
in there and I've been doing,

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.822
and I've been dropping them

01:13:04.841 --> 01:13:06.462
on my desk and I've been doing a lot of,

01:13:06.603 --> 01:13:08.043
um, comic book stuff.

01:13:08.264 --> 01:13:09.003
So I'm like, okay,

01:13:09.024 --> 01:13:10.305
this would be a good thing to pick up.

01:13:10.824 --> 01:13:11.865
And I'm trying to look at

01:13:11.886 --> 01:13:13.167
screens less before bed.

01:13:13.667 --> 01:13:14.426
So I've been, uh,

01:13:15.188 --> 01:13:16.868
just reading through this lately.

01:13:17.269 --> 01:13:17.309
Um,

01:13:18.421 --> 01:13:20.662
Yeah, not quite as big,

01:13:21.462 --> 01:13:23.462
as interesting as the three-body problem,

01:13:23.502 --> 01:13:25.043
but it helps me go to sleep.

01:13:25.743 --> 01:13:27.203
What was that last thing that you held up?

01:13:27.984 --> 01:13:29.345
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

01:13:29.564 --> 01:13:32.185
That's volume one, volume two.

01:13:33.046 --> 01:13:33.445
I see.

01:13:34.226 --> 01:13:35.106
I didn't know it was a

01:13:35.167 --> 01:13:36.067
written work of art.

01:13:36.728 --> 01:13:38.408
Yeah, I believe that's how it started,

01:13:38.467 --> 01:13:39.368
and then I think they made

01:13:39.408 --> 01:13:41.088
the video game and then the movie.

01:13:41.668 --> 01:13:42.890
Interesting.

01:13:42.930 --> 01:13:43.850
But the video game,

01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:46.371
the art for that is a guy named

01:13:46.734 --> 01:13:48.274
Paul Robinson, I think,

01:13:48.335 --> 01:13:49.595
perhaps G or whatever.

01:13:50.036 --> 01:13:52.216
And he's just a phenomenal pixel artist.

01:13:52.235 --> 01:13:53.697
And I just, I,

01:13:53.737 --> 01:13:54.777
my work doesn't come close

01:13:54.796 --> 01:13:55.676
to his and I got a style

01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:56.676
that I could do in two seconds,

01:13:56.697 --> 01:13:58.238
but he spends like years

01:13:58.257 --> 01:14:00.037
building these amazing animations.

01:14:00.057 --> 01:14:01.019
It's phenomenal.

01:14:01.639 --> 01:14:02.139
So.

01:14:04.418 --> 01:14:04.759
Right on.

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:05.500
Cool.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:05.960
Well, Matt,

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.359
thanks again for coming on the show.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.240

01:14:09.261 --> 01:14:10.860
will definitely have you back on.

01:14:12.613 --> 01:14:13.293

01:14:20.877 --> 01:14:22.198
any of that kind of stuff.

01:14:22.318 --> 01:14:24.600
You can find me most of

01:14:24.619 --> 01:14:25.640
those places at Schematical.

01:14:25.699 --> 01:14:27.180
I try and grab it anywhere I can.

01:14:27.201 --> 01:14:27.360
Okay.

01:14:28.242 --> 01:14:28.462
Yeah.

01:14:29.141 --> 01:14:30.382
So check it out on Schematical.

01:14:30.682 --> 01:14:33.064
And thanks for listening.

01:14:33.243 --> 01:14:34.265
And we'll see everyone next week.
