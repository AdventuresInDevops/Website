We're joined by 20 year industry veteran and DevOps advocate, [Adam Korga](https://adamkorga.com/), celebrating the release of his book [IT Dictionary](https://amzn.to/4gR9jOW). In this episode we quickly get down to the inspiration behind postmortems as we review some cornerstone cases both in software and in general technology.

Adam shares how he started in the industry, long before DevOps was a coined term, focused on making systems safer and avoiding mistakes like accidentally dropping a production database. we review the infamous incidents of accidental database deletion, by LLMs and human's alike.

And of course we touch on the quintessential postmortems in civil engineering, flight, and survivorship bias from World War II through analyzing bullet holes on returning planes.
