Sylvain Kalache, Head of Developer Relations at [Rootly](https://labs.rootly.ai/) joins us to explore the new frontier of incident response powered by large language models. We dive into the evolution of DevRel and how we meet the new challenges impacting our systems.

We explore Sylvain's origin story in self-healing systems, dating back to his SlideShare and LinkedIn days. From ingesting logs via Fluentd to building early ML-driven RCA tools, he shares a vision of self-healing infrastructure that targets root causes rather than just restarting boxes. Plus, we trace the historical arc of deterministic and non-deterministic tools.

The conversation shifts toward real-world applications, where we're combining logs, metrics, transcripts, and postmortems to give SREs superpowers. We get tactical on integrating LLMs, why fine-tuning isn't always worth it, and how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) could be the USB of AI ops, but how it is still insecure. We wrap by facing the harsh reality of "incident vibing" in a world increasingly built by prompts, not people—and how to prepare for it.
