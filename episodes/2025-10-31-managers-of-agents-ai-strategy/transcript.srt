1
00:00:00,134 --> 00:00:03,795
And welcome back to another episode of Adventures in DevOps.

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:13,543
I'm Warren, your host, and today I am really excited, and I know I say that pretty
frequently, but I am actually excited today for today's guest who we brought on the show,

3
00:00:13,543 --> 00:00:23,008
partner and general manager at Microsoft for Developer Relations, focusing on everything
coding related, has quite the experiences in consulting and software development, and

4
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:26,480
before that, principal technical architect at Disney.

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,112
Welcome to the show, John Papa.

6
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:28,993
Thanks for having me, Warren.

7
00:00:28,993 --> 00:00:32,095
I'm excited to have a conversation with you and your audience today.

8
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:41,978
Honestly, I almost wanted to click record when we were talking pre-show because we're
going quite the conversations about just everything that's happening in today's world at

9
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:44,860
Microsoft, other companies, security, et cetera.

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,882
I think most of that is just really interesting, especially throughout your whole
background.

11
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:54,664
I've got to say though, early in my career, it was clear to me that I thought I wanted
nothing to do with Microsoft.

12
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:57,226
I never thought I would touch a Microsoft product or

13
00:00:57,226 --> 00:00:59,967
by anything that Microsoft ever created in a million years.

14
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:03,070
But solely my perspective on that has really been changing.

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,635
And I've seen them transition through purchasing quite the assortment of brands that money
can buy.

16
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:13,317
Xbox, the open source community most importantly, even heavily into Linux now.

17
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:19,609
And anyone that knows me knows that I'm just like such a huge fan of VS Code compared to
all the other IDEs.

18
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,130
There's really just no alternative for me.

19
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,436
So I'm like,

20
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:24,373
really happy that you're on the show and I can pick your brain about some of those.

21
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:29,369
Yeah, sure, and we can talk too about I wasn't too much unlike you for a period of my
life.

22
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:37,881
So it's not a place I thought I'd find myself back as Microsoft, but I am back here and
I'm all Macs, all Apple, all my products.

23
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:40,915
Everything I use is not Microsoft OS.

24
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:42,718
So it's an interesting life I have.

25
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:50,865
That's got to be a special experience to be on the developer relations team and not
actually be such an avid Microsoft product user.

26
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:53,357
Is your PR department having anything to say about that?

27
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:58,748
We'll see after they hear this episode, but all the devices and hardware and OSes I use,
they're all Apple.

28
00:01:58,748 --> 00:02:04,179
I just like the ecosystem and I'm a web guy at heart for the last 15 years.

29
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:11,859
15 years ago, it wasn't really fun to use web with Microsoft products and Windows and
whatnot.

30
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:15,319
And I could tell you a horror stories there, but it's gotten a lot better.

31
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,686
And the good news is...

32
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:21,581
Today, the machines really don't matter as much as the cloud services and the other kind
of services.

33
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:24,964
it's the APIs and the AI and Azure is amazing.

34
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:27,166
I love the cloud services at Microsoft.

35
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,538
Big fan of those, big fan of VS Code.

36
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:31,750
It's actually the biggest reason I came back to Microsoft.

37
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,836
So I was like, you mean I don't have to get a Windows machine?

38
00:02:34,836 --> 00:02:38,178
I don't have to buy a Windows phone gasp or whatever else?

39
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:39,210
They're like, no.

40
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,953
So I'm like, all right, I'm sold.

41
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:49,632
If you can come back and not have to sell your soul to the ecosystem and you have freedom
of choice, I think that's a developer's dream come true

42
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:59,284
And I have to say, before I was using VS code, I tried things like Sublime and Atom and
Visual Studio Code back in the day when I was working at a Microsoft shop and we were

43
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:01,726
doing Visual Basic and then .NET.

44
00:03:01,726 --> 00:03:07,809
And I remember trying to run Linux and Mono to even compile C Sharp to run times for
Linux.

45
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:11,850
there was just like standard things that just did not work out of the box whatsoever.

46
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,521
And it's just so night and day now.

47
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:22,692
that the company that had released these products that only under certification or
licenses were you able to use are now leading the open source community.

48
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:26,286
MPM, GitHub, it doesn't matter what products we're talking about there as far as Git
service go.

49
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:28,388
Microsoft is the open source community

50
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:29,548
Yeah, it really is.

51
00:03:29,548 --> 00:03:36,468
And Microsoft's is, it's funny, there's a cohort at Microsoft that's been around for a
long time, who's been heavily into open source and big advocates of it.

52
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:45,979
And to be honest, for a while back in, I'm going to say the late 2005, 2010 era, it was
hard to be in a Microsoft's OSS.

53
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:48,430
And I worked there for two years back during that timeframe.

54
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,870
And I lived in Seattle and then I decided to move to Florida.

55
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,752
So I left, didn't have anything to with their open source policy.

56
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:55,573
But I was just like, know, it was hard.

57
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:59,946
It was difficult because even then it was like, I'd have people on.

58
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:04,240
had a video cast we did with Silverlight and Flash way back in the day.

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,662
And having people on using a Mac, it was very much frowned upon.

60
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:09,383
like, but this is what people are using.

61
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,944
Like, let's actually show the devices.

62
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:16,888
Who cares what device they use if they're using your services and products somewhere in
the story?

63
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:18,310
Like that's part of the journey.

64
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,242
Embrace the differences.

65
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:23,902
And it's completely flipped, which is what I love about this.

66
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:28,653
I went back to Microsoft to think 2017 and at that point I was already convinced.

67
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:36,263
I was two years after VS Code came out and I was part of that story of when VS Code came
out as well, which I'm very proud of.

68
00:04:36,263 --> 00:04:37,225
I was like you.

69
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:42,976
I started with Visual Studio for many years and I was a .NET C Sharp VB .NET kind of
person.

70
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:46,347
And I got away from it because doing web with that was just not working.

71
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:47,718
and for a lot of reasons.

72
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:51,918
So I got away from that and I went to a Mac and I'm like, all right, I'm gonna try all the
editors.

73
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:58,140
And I did an experiment for a year in 2016, where every month I tried a different editor
while I was working at Disney.

74
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:08,057
I tried Sublime, Atom, Brackets, Vim, forgetting some of the other names, WebStorm, you
know, of course, what's now VS Code, tried Visual Studio.

75
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,348
There were a couple that are dead and gone that I can't remember.

76
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:16,512
There were blog posts about this and it got the attention of some Microsoft people and
they invited me up to Redmond to have a conversation.

77
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:20,194
And I felt like I was in this cloaked dark room with a bunch of people I'd never met
before.

78
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,046
Long story short, turns out they were planning VS Code.

79
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:26,570
And the kind they called it Ticino, which is a region in Switzerland.

80
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,743
And Eric Gamma, know, the Gang of Four, famous for the Gang of Four patterns book was
there.

81
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:33,605
I didn't know he were from Microsoft at the time.

82
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,078
He created Eclipse as well.

83
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:39,311
He was there, Chris Diaz, Scott Hunter, a bunch of other people at Microsoft.

84
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:42,082
They're like, what makes you think we wouldn't make a great open source editor?

85
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:46,173
And they started picking my brains on all the I liked about all the different editors,
things I didn't like.

86
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:52,966
Fast forward a couple months later, May of 2015, and they were like, they were gonna
launch it at Build.

87
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,417
And they invited me on stage to talk about it.

88
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,008
And I was like, absolutely.

89
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:57,919
It was just awesome.

90
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,061
Like this is actually a really cool editor.

91
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:03,043
The biggest gap they had at the time when they launched it was no extensions.

92
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,746
you imagine no marketplace for extensions for an editor?

93
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:10,690
But they launched it so fast it wasn't there until a couple months later, but it was still
pretty amazing.

94
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,573
it really, really enjoyed that time.

95
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:23,733
I do think that there was a huge change in the usability of VS code by shifting to
allowing not just the marketplace, but the external language servers to be able to support

96
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:30,272
those independently, which may mean through extensions or realistically through the
architecture, I do understand the challenge with marketplaces though.

97
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:33,543
You're talking a lot and I think this is one the things we see today.

98
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:40,428
malicious actors utilizing this as a mechanism for deploying vulnerabilities into IDEs.

99
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:48,194
I think the biggest one that came out was this Darkula theme that had just as many
downloads as the dark theme Dracula.

100
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:55,340
And I think it's a really cleverly, cleverly named to extension because it sounds like it
should be Darkula if you really think about it.

101
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,022
And so it just so many downloads and just malicious.

102
00:06:58,022 --> 00:07:00,485
So I understand the reasoning there, but it sounds like

103
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:09,580
you are to thank, for the VS Code experience, the IDE experience that software engineers
have available today, maybe not in the last couple of years.

104
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,434
We can thank the Vibe Coders for that.

105
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:14,536
Yeah, I definitely had a hand, very small hand in that.

106
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:18,876
It definitely wasn't all of my opinions they took, but it was nice that they reached out
too.

107
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:21,436
You can think about it, they didn't have to do this.

108
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:27,767
They could have been like, we've created Visual Studio, which at the time was the largest
editor in use anywhere in the world, bigger than any other editor.

109
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:33,509
I don't know how many millions and tens of millions of users, but they could have been
like, not built here, not invented here.

110
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:35,560
We're gonna do it, we know better than everybody else.

111
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,911
And they reached out and looked for people to figure out how to make this work.

112
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:39,832
And they still do that.

113
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:48,337
We still do that, which is one of the things I love about working at Microsoft is there is
a, it's not the whole company, like, you know, company is huge, but there are parts of the

114
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:55,811
company that I work with that I love because like developer division, they are always
looking for how do we get real live customer feedback?

115
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,502
Who are these people using these things and what do they do?

116
00:07:58,502 --> 00:07:59,157
What are they like?

117
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:00,043
What are they not like?

118
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:03,104
To me, that's what makes me thrive in developer relations.

119
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:11,701
that's one thing that actually will follow co-hosts who's not here today often talks
about, especially with the product management experience, really trying to figure out the

120
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:19,445
difference between what you are building or what you want to build and then the product
you actually end up with once you take customer feedback is just so different.

121
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:27,908
And often if you're not paying attention, you will end up with, I think this is why we see
a lot of historically fail is they're not really doing the product management.

122
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:37,093
And I see a lot of startups today, they realize that they have this need for a business or
sales or marketing even, and then engineering if they haven't outsourced it,

123
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:37,853
unfortunately.

124
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:40,454
But they still don't understand the goal of product management.

125
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:48,587
They don't understand that, you know, where they want to end up with six months or a year
or five years down the road because they're so focused in maybe VC funding or just getting

126
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:49,117
investment.

127
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:52,959
so that's for sure the thing that feels like it gets thrown out the window.

128
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,810
And I can understand it though, because

129
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:01,887
It's very difficult to find good product managers out there that actually want to
understand and do the market research.

130
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:12,788
And the fact that specifically VS code, really Microsoft has taken this approach really
shows that you can understand the long-term market here rather than just release something

131
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:15,573
and having an opinion-based development strategy.

132
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:19,066
And I'm sure it happens more often than not too.

133
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:23,320
there's definitely, we release a product it seems like we're such a big company all the
time, like every day.

134
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,993
But like with VSCO, what's great is there's no more a release cycle.

135
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:33,668
Like the years ago when I worked at Microsoft back in the late 2000 era, it was like once
a year, you get a version of something.

136
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:37,852
Now if you go more than a week without seeing a change in a product, you're surprised.

137
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:43,328
Although I do wonder, it's funny, we used to make fun of JavaScript flavor of the week
back when JavaScript was going crazy.

138
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:45,941
A new framework of the week would come out and then just disappear.

139
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:50,947
Now it feels like, are we hitting people with new AI feature of the week?

140
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:52,018
What's going on out there?

141
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:56,233
Not just us, but Anthropic and Amazon and everybody and Meta.

142
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,604
There's so much we can say here.

143
00:09:57,604 --> 00:09:58,944
I mean, I think you're onto something.

144
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:07,397
And I think part of it may just be the PR news cycle, realizing they need to keep the ball
rolling with whatever audience that they've captured they need to throw out something.

145
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:10,248
Otherwise, you'll feel like, oh, well, they stopped innovating.

146
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:11,859
That means they're not doing anything anymore.

147
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:14,577
And what was interesting is actually on the...

148
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:24,864
episode the previous episode that we just recorded with incident IO we theorized that we
may be at a point where we have all of the whatever innovations we've had with LLMs have

149
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:34,343
come to the maximum point like from this technology and now it's no longer about building
something better but we can actually build stuff with that technology more so than try to

150
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:40,901
innovate in that space specifically but yeah I see a lot of these product release features
that we see out there today and

151
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:49,977
They don't really make a big impact, but it's interesting because especially with VS Code,
maybe I'll ask you specifically, what your feeling is on the co-pilots of the world, the

152
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:54,089
things that in our experience we get really close to integrating with.

153
00:10:54,089 --> 00:11:02,526
So we're using an IDE and we're talking about auto-completion or just engaging with just
collaboration inside our tool of choice.

154
00:11:02,526 --> 00:11:08,072
Yeah, think it's, I think where it is today is not where it's gonna be in a couple of
years, first of all, and all the products.

155
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:13,477
I don't have any insight on this that I'm sharing just other than my feeling is this
stuff's changed so fast.

156
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:15,967
And you go back to a couple of years ago and Copilot came out.

157
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,841
It's nowhere near what it is today,

158
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:25,801
And effectively for a while people and I think a lot of people still think it's just auto
complete on steroids where you're typing and suddenly you get a suggestion and there you

159
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:26,061
go.

160
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:29,281
There's some more code, but there's so much more it can do.

161
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:38,481
And this is because of all the competition that's out there and because the rapid rise,
the models and the way that they're using this and all the chip usage in the backend too,

162
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:41,132
which we keep hearing about, know, and Nvidia must be loving that.

163
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:45,672
But you look at this and I think where we are now is we've got this world of agentic AI.

164
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,319
And what I mean by that is

165
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:56,623
the most effective way to use AI in our tools today, whether it's WebStorm or IntelliJ or
Eclipse or Visual Studio Code or Claude or whatever it might be, Cursor, Windsor, who

166
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:56,984
knows?

167
00:11:56,984 --> 00:12:01,228
All these tools are relying upon these AI models in an agentic way.

168
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:06,300
They want to be, this is my words, they want us all to become managers of agents.

169
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,623
So the future of developers, and I'm a developer at heart, been with her decades.

170
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:17,274
It's not me managing a team of 20 people offshore and in-house to get my work done.

171
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:23,345
There will still be those people, but all those people are now going to become managers of
AI agents.

172
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:25,956
So imagine this, we've got a backlog of work.

173
00:12:25,956 --> 00:12:30,807
We use an agent inside of VS Code, for example, or Cursor, or Claude, or whatever you
choose.

174
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:35,849
We use an agent to read our spec files, requirements on our business users, which, let's
be honest,

175
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:40,220
80 % of the time it makes sense to us as devs and 20 % of the time we have no idea what
they're asking for.

176
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,971
So we just guess, right?

177
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,431
Hopefully we ask.

178
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:48,552
Yeah, yeah.

179
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:52,574
But it depends how honest you are with yourself and how much you want to ask the business
people.

180
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:54,035
Like what exactly did you want?

181
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:58,589
And then I go back and work on my stuff with the agent and come back an hour later and all
that stuff's there.

182
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:04,144
And you think about that at the end of a day, you could literally have 10 issues ready to
go, you know, with your manual review.

183
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:08,018
I would never recommend automatic pull request merging.

184
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:15,849
And I'm going to say right now that by the time I retire and I'm out of this industry,
we're not going to have that, please.

185
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:17,541
I don't want that happening.

186
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:21,232
I want a human to be there to say, yes, this is good or no, it's not.

187
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:27,253
But I do love the fact that the agentic world is pulling us to this era of we're gonna be
agents of, sorry, managers of agents.

188
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:33,757
like your optimistic perspective and I also like the optimistic perspective of expecting
that humans will be in the loop there.

189
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:45,065
I think part of the trouble is that we often see a lot of companies spinning up with this
belief or their marketing materials saying otherwise that you can just go to town and it

190
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:53,431
will do everything for you and then you end up with like the replets of the world that are
deciding to just delete production databases filled with user data because

191
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:55,061
That seemed like a good idea at the time.

192
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:56,585
You know, I don't think there's any avoidance.

193
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,357
slash Y.

194
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:58,570
Is this a good idea, agent?

195
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,155
Absolutely, run with it.

196
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:01,806
Yeah, I hear you.

197
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:10,003
what's really interesting from that perspective that you've shared is that I feel like
don't want to say GitHub specifically, but maybe it's Microsoft, maybe it's GitHub, maybe

198
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:19,767
it's just VS Code, whatever the agent is that's running there, is having the expectations
about how to do software development or how to do each of those pieces specifically,

199
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:27,530
knowing that it should, say, break down a particular request, user request or support
request, et cetera, into things that could be user stories.

200
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,972
that then can be converted into tickets and then run with that.

201
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:33,215
And I find that that's the thing that needs to be done.

202
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:41,623
And where we're at a mismatch is a lot of these agents today are focusing on, like as you
said, managing them and telling them what the right process is.

203
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:50,469
But I find that that's the whole challenge, making sure that there is the right process in
play, making sure that it is not commenting on those if statements, knowing when to make

204
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:51,700
the right trade-offs.

205
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,494
And you still have to convey that context.

206
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,640
to the agent in order to make it do those things correctly.

207
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,281
You do, and I think you're hitting the nail on the head with a couple areas.

208
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:02,783
One is you have to give the agents context today.

209
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:05,164
I'm sure that'll lessen over time.

210
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:12,536
Like there's some things that probably would make sense for the agents and the models to
just all knock a little, like, come on, good comments should be a thing that isn't, we all

211
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,656
disagree on in the world.

212
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:15,378
So models should figure that out.

213
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:19,570
But what your process is would differ from company to company or even team to team.

214
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,522
So you've got to give it that context.

215
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:26,694
And that's where things like agents MD, which has become like the universally accepted or
unofficially adopted.

216
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:33,129
This is how you tell your tools, whether you're using a VS code or Claude, this is how you
tell it that this is what you want it to do.

217
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:40,095
But the other side is, and I think we miss this a lot, is that the skills that we've
learned over the years are still very valid.

218
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:45,267
Like you've still got to have, notice I'm not saying skip having issues, skip having a
backlog.

219
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:47,178
Skip having pull requests and code review.

220
00:15:47,178 --> 00:15:49,290
No, all that is good context.

221
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,591
Small pull requests, good idea.

222
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:53,991
I'm putting that in my context from my agent MD.

223
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:58,643
Please don't give me a 40 file, 7,000 line PR.

224
00:15:58,643 --> 00:16:00,405
I don't want it, I can't consume it.

225
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:02,266
I'm either gonna reject it or just accept it.

226
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:05,159
And God forbid I accept it, because now I don't know what half of it's doing.

227
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:11,870
There are skills that we've learned, whether you went to school or not, and that's not
part of this chat here, but you've learned skills as an engineer over the years.

228
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,781
Those skills are not going away.

229
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:15,132
Like that's a foundation.

230
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:16,472
Will you be doing those?

231
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:17,903
And let me give you an analogy of this.

232
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:21,003
I learned SQL years ago in college.

233
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:22,603
Like I had a whole course on it.

234
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:26,254
I wrote four books on SQL in the late 90s.

235
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:28,514
Nobody really gets that anymore.

236
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:29,725
And it's okay.

237
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:30,125
Like...

238
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:34,618
That is a lower level language now that we're using tools to write for us and do for us.

239
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,499
Is it a skill that I think should have gone away?

240
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:42,264
No, because there's times you need to look at those SQL statements to understand how is it
actually getting the data?

241
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:44,404
Is it doing it in an optimal, efficient way?

242
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:45,645
Is it actually getting the data?

243
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:47,608
think it is too, in some cases.

244
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:54,442
Like that's still a skill to have, but it's not a skill, whereas in the 90s, you might be
writing SQL statements for two, three hours a day.

245
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,044
You're not writing for two, three hours a week anymore.

246
00:16:57,044 --> 00:16:58,635
It's completely different.

247
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:00,106
And I think that's a good thing.

248
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:05,759
The skills that we've learned along the way, even before AI, were really valuable to us
getting to this point.

249
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:15,524
And hopefully we can use AI to continue to make the tooling better, to abstract some of
those away that's more monotonous, and then give us insight into here's places you need to

250
00:17:15,524 --> 00:17:15,904
look.

251
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:19,067
I created this code, is this logic what you wanted?

252
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:23,868
And that's the kind of stuff I'm looking for AI to give me more on, is be that pair
programming partner.

253
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:28,699
I want agent to be that thing that gives me a gut check to rubber duck.

254
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:31,110
And I still want to have that human involvement.

255
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:38,370
I do think it's a mistake when people start talking about, and I'm not suggesting you
were, but I've heard people say that, you know, we're going to get to a point where we

256
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,661
even need to learn computer skills.

257
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:42,183
No, and let me leave you with this thought on that.

258
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:51,697
I had this wonderful tweet, which I'll keep anonymous, where somebody put out earlier this
year, my whole SaaS system was built with some tool, zero handwritten code, AI is not just

259
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,925
an assistant anymore, and yes, people pay for it.

260
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:59,217
And then just a couple days later, the person's like, I'm under attack.

261
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:02,110
Ever since I started building this thing, and I'm paraphrasing.

262
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:07,085
We maxed out on API, people are bypassing subscriptions, creating random stuff on the DB.

263
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:09,987
I'm not technical, so this taking me longer than normal to figure out.

264
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:15,989
For now, I'm just gonna stop sharing what I do publicly on this social platform, and
there's just some weird people out there.

265
00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:21,070
Yeah, that's a canonical security via obscurity there to solve the problem.

266
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:34,070
I almost want to take the side of the VibeCoder and argue against this, but first, I think
it's really interesting to see that there was a recent release by an executive working at

267
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:41,601
a cloud hyperscaler who suggested that it was a good thing to have such a high percentage
of code being written by

268
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:51,782
Almost on the same day, there was a huge major incident at that cloud provider that took
much longer than previous incidents to actually resolve.

269
00:18:51,782 --> 00:19:00,928
And I think we see these and I worry that they're going to happen more and more as we
potentially are keep getting closer to wanting to pull the human out of the loop there.

270
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:07,703
And you made an interesting point about expecting say the pull request that an agent or
some LLM is generating for us.

271
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:09,135
to be small in nature.

272
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:19,781
And I really wonder whether or not it wouldn't be better to stop thinking about code being
generated, just like we stop thinking about the lower primitives of bytecode or what

273
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:30,747
happens in assembly oh after the linker integrated before, know, after we compile it are
running and realize that maybe that tools like Git or, you know, saving the diffs, like

274
00:19:30,747 --> 00:19:34,862
that's not the optimal output that we could be capturing.

275
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:41,907
when utilizing an agent, but I don't know what the right answer is because I do see these
other systems that are attempting to jump in the middle here and they suggest that you

276
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:44,950
commit specs to the repository and you review those.

277
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:52,486
And I don't love that either because I feel like the output often is highly fluctuates
based off of the model you pick or the generation.

278
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:55,169
And as you pointed out, you still need someone to review it.

279
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:59,844
And how can we review millions of lines of code just as that?

280
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:02,076
know what every developer is thinking here.

281
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,899
Testing and debugging code, that's my favorite part of being a developer.

282
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:10,203
You know, you're reminding me of, again, going back 10 years, when I was at Disney.

283
00:20:10,203 --> 00:20:12,565
So I worked at Walt Disney, it's part of my history.

284
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:14,767
And I live five minutes from Disney.

285
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:16,557
In fact, I'm going there tonight for dinner.

286
00:20:16,557 --> 00:20:23,923
my role there was to basically do engineering excellence, which is just a group of
basically saying, how do we make sure that everybody across all these places around the

287
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,055
world are developing the same way?

288
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:28,958
First, I told my vice president.

289
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,029
you need to like this.

290
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,929
I don't think everybody should develop exactly the same way.

291
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,689
And he's like, well, that's too bad for your job.

292
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:38,920
So we had an interesting, interesting, professional relationship.

293
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,851
But what I did was I said, you know, I think there's certain things we should all agree
on.

294
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:46,762
You know, whether you're using different languages or processes or tools.

295
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:54,992
And I came up with just to be, because I worked at Disney, everything begins with a D at
Disney, you know, because Disney everything, Disney parks, Disneyland, you know.

296
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:59,274
So what I came up with was the seven D's of development and everything was there.

297
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:00,906
I'm like, all right, we got to think about these things.

298
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:03,287
And I'm going to, this is going back about 14 years.

299
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:04,539
So bear with me.

300
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:08,231
I think there was, there was in no particular order documentation.

301
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:09,622
You needed to have some kind of documentation.

302
00:21:09,622 --> 00:21:17,384
What the heck you were doing, usually from the business people in general, talking about
that book because big book of specs that you get, you know, 20 years ago and throw that in

303
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:18,314
the garbage.

304
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:21,761
So some kind of documentation, you've got to have some kind of design work.

305
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:27,346
Like before you actually build it, maybe you should like figure out what you're gonna
build first before you just sit down.

306
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:31,400
Even if you're vibe coding today, like you gotta have an idea of what you're doing, right?

307
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,122
So document, design, actually development.

308
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:35,493
There's the big D, right?

309
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:36,375
That's going in there.

310
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,648
There was destroy, which was testing.

311
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:40,299
So you've gotta have a way to destroy it.

312
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,300
It had to be a D.

313
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,553
So gotta find a way to put a D in front of testing.

314
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,434
Let's see what else do we have.

315
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:45,935
Deploy was one of them.

316
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:46,827
I'm leaving.

317
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:47,948
that I can't remember.

318
00:21:47,948 --> 00:21:52,361
And then the final one was I couldn't come up with a good D for reviewing.

319
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:55,153
So I called it, and I'm Italian, so I called it the review.

320
00:21:55,153 --> 00:21:57,104
So the seventh D was the review.

321
00:21:57,104 --> 00:21:58,076
You got to do it.

322
00:21:58,076 --> 00:22:02,528
So with this review, effectively, you had to have a code review process.

323
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:03,809
And we put these things in place.

324
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:05,339
We made posters of it and everything.

325
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:08,211
We used Marvel characters because Marvel was big back then.

326
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:10,646
And I said, everybody's got to do these seven things.

327
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:15,646
Notice none of those said you've got to use Java or Python or JavaScript or whatever.

328
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:18,057
It didn't say you to use AWS or Google or Azure.

329
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:22,088
It was all about making sure you had the process in place.

330
00:22:22,088 --> 00:22:27,759
And part of the reviewer process was you had to have two people review your code who
weren't you.

331
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,110
And that was the most contentious thing that I ever did there.

332
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,861
Because people were like, well, no, I got to deploy, man.

333
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:36,212
okay, so you're going to write code and go?

334
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:41,103
And let me tell you what happens at Disney when you just write code and deploy.

335
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:42,340
have two interesting stories.

336
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,681
so I was called into this.

337
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:50,544
They called it the war room at the time, which was a terrible name for it, but it gives
you an idea of when they deployed.

338
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:56,217
They basically had this massive room that looked like something out of, you know, Def Con
3 from War Games movie, the early eighties.

339
00:22:56,217 --> 00:23:02,768
And they would deploy and they'd have all these systems online looking going, okay, we
just deployed a thing over here to this park.

340
00:23:02,768 --> 00:23:04,648
Is the rest of the park still running?

341
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:07,299
Like, let's make sure, because everything was intertangled back then.

342
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:11,730
You know, we didn't have all this separation in this world of tech, nowhere did.

343
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,101
So they called me and they said, okay, we have a problem.

344
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:23,411
We just hired this company to, and I'll keep the company names out of it, company to come
in and basically create locks on all of our doors of our hotel room.

345
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:25,783
Keep in mind, Disney has like 30 resorts.

346
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:29,395
And I don't know how many rooms they have today, but there's probably 100,000 rooms.

347
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:32,844
It's Probably the world's largest single place to have hotel rooms.

348
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:36,717
And like we picked a couple of the resorts to do this test with them and we deployed it.

349
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:41,791
And the deployment was effectively that when you use your magic bands, which at the time
were just coming out.

350
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:47,825
So first wearable device, you know, talking about 15 years ago, you tap it on the door and
it will unlock your door.

351
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:48,757
instead of a room key.

352
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:49,895
Today, that's everywhere.

353
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,759
15 years ago, this didn't exist.

354
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,185
And this company's, everything failed, everything.

355
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:56,257
And they're like, can you help us figure this out?

356
00:23:56,257 --> 00:23:59,289
And so we had the people at the company who created the locking systems.

357
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:00,990
Like that's what they do is create locking systems.

358
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,223
They're not highly into the tech, right?

359
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:04,474
They knew the tech, but not as much.

360
00:24:04,474 --> 00:24:05,446
There are more locks.

361
00:24:05,446 --> 00:24:09,300
Then we had our developers, and then we had our, basically our executives.

362
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,349
And they're all trying to talk.

363
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,453
And it was like talk in three different languages.

364
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:14,304
you know, a Tower Babel kind of thing.

365
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:15,704
And they're like explaining it all.

366
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,864
I'm just sitting back and listening.

367
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:20,915
At one point they go, yeah, and you know, we're not sure where the problem is because
here's what we do.

368
00:24:20,915 --> 00:24:21,695
This is the process.

369
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:29,386
They're explaining the process of how the lock signal goes to the server, which is under a
desk at the front of the hotel.

370
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:32,657
the first thing that peeked my head, I'm like, where is it?

371
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:33,948
All right, keep going.

372
00:24:33,948 --> 00:24:36,641
like, yeah, and we're using, what kind of database are you using?

373
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,332
Oh, we're using this thing called the Jet database.

374
00:24:39,332 --> 00:24:40,793
And everyone's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

375
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:41,552
No one had heard of it.

376
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:43,104
I'm like, the Jet database?

377
00:24:43,104 --> 00:24:45,867
like, you mean the thing that runs Microsoft Access?

378
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:47,710
And they're like, yeah, why?

379
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,202
And at the time, Access was not a multi-user.

380
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:51,982
I didn't even know if Access exists anymore.

381
00:24:51,982 --> 00:24:53,864
Gosh, it isn't today that I work at Microsoft.

382
00:24:53,864 --> 00:25:03,282
But they were basically running 5,000 rooms at this one resort, and they're locking
mechanisms off a single database underneath the front desk hotel server running.

383
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:07,758
on a single power strip with no backup on a database that doesn't handle multiple
connections.

384
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:13,543
And on top of it all, they had a router that only handled one, think was handling all
5,000 switches, one call at a time.

385
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:16,876
And if there was more than one, it would back up the second and it would throw away the
rest.

386
00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:19,258
And they asked me if I had any suggestions.

387
00:25:19,258 --> 00:25:20,420
And I said, yeah, don't do that.

388
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:20,821
what's...

389
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:24,995
And I'm telling you this story not because it's a rip on the company, but to say that this
happened.

390
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:28,388
because they deployed without trying or having other people look at things.

391
00:25:28,388 --> 00:25:31,460
One person had the idea to try this and that person worked for Disney.

392
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,972
So it's not just the company's fault.

393
00:25:32,972 --> 00:25:35,805
And that person was like, hey, let's deploy it, give it a go.

394
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:40,309
I guarantee you if more than one person looked at that, somebody would have said, hey,
wait a minute.

395
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:44,526
And of course that stuff's all resolved today and much more multi-tenant, you know.

396
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:50,692
And I am taking a little liberty with some of the discovery there, but that's what happens
when you don't have people look at your code.

397
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:59,570
I hate the story because I totally believe that this is actually still happening at some
companies today, hands down, no question.

398
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:05,035
But I do fully believe that these sorts of things that are fixed and improved at Disney.

399
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:12,901
For anyone who's just listening now and not watching the episode, have to say, John's in
one of the most amazing recording rooms that I've seen.

400
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:15,313
There is memorabilia all over the place.

401
00:26:15,313 --> 00:26:16,554
It is quite a...

402
00:26:16,554 --> 00:26:26,193
a joy to look at with Stormtroopers and the Octocat and multiple Mickey Mouse's in Italian
and you've just got too many things here to name.

403
00:26:26,193 --> 00:26:30,579
I think your Obi-Wan Kenobi is blinking red in the background for some reason.

404
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:31,071
Yeah, he is.

405
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:32,069
I'm not sure why.

406
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:35,183
I think that's just a trick of the lights, but I see it.

407
00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:36,928
Yep.

408
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:46,419
And I still think that's quite an innovation in the last 15 years to really focus on,
well, 99 % of your work is like not even doing the development realistically.

409
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:49,059
And I throw in business practices there.

410
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:55,594
you're at the end of the day, you're there to solve a problem, is realistically walking
and unlocking, you know, in your example from Disney.

411
00:26:55,594 --> 00:27:01,182
the hotel room doors for the customers, rather than solving just an arbitrary software
problem.

412
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:07,996
And when you're looking at that regard, I think this really just makes the whole story
about getting customer feedback and really testing it in a way that makes sense and not

413
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:10,538
just deploying it and calling it a day.

414
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:17,520
And I honestly don't know where I'm going with this, but yeah, yeah, for sure.

415
00:27:17,843 --> 00:27:18,534
No question.

416
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:26,474
Yeah, you know, there was something else you made me think of with testing too, which is a
different story, not as long as we were working on something.

417
00:27:26,474 --> 00:27:30,614
We had this thing, used to be a thing called, oh my gosh, Disney's Magical Express.

418
00:27:30,614 --> 00:27:33,501
Basically, they pick you up from the airport in a bus and bring you back to the hotels.

419
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:36,232
And there was this system basically where,

420
00:27:36,232 --> 00:27:39,785
They had some custom devices before iPhones and stuff are super popular.

421
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,557
iPhones were early edition at this time.

422
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:49,463
And they had these like custom Android devices or Windows device camera, which they were,
where you could basically build, give it to the person at the airport who worked for

423
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:51,345
Disney to say, it's, hey, it's Warren.

424
00:27:51,345 --> 00:27:55,998
And he's here with his family in these four bags and they're going to, you know, this
hotel, the Contemporary.

425
00:27:55,998 --> 00:27:58,273
They get on the bus, they're on bus 42.

426
00:27:58,273 --> 00:28:00,345
The bus driver has it, says, yep, they're here.

427
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:05,039
and they get to the hotel, somebody checks them in on the app again on the same kind of
device, and they get in.

428
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,252
It's just a very simple app process, not a lot of functionality, but it helps.

429
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:12,454
I think at the time it was running 25 million luggage pieces a year.

430
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:16,469
It was insane, like the amount of throughput this thing was going through, and there were
people.

431
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:21,543
And we had to rebuild it for some other crazy reasons, and we had to rebuild this quickly.

432
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:24,015
And I remember the biggest contentious part I had was,

433
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:26,355
Like we don't have, I said, I want to do a field test.

434
00:28:26,355 --> 00:28:28,106
We're like, we don't have time for field tests.

435
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:33,968
Like I know this works sitting in my cube, but I want to go to the airport, get on a bus.

436
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:35,308
I want to do all the steps.

437
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:39,299
I don't have to give to all the users if you don't want to, but let me be the person who
does it.

438
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:40,739
And like, why would you want to do this?

439
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:44,019
I'm like, because at the airport, I'm on airport wifi.

440
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:46,590
While I'm on the bus, yeah.

441
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,690
And then I'm on cell phone when I'm on the bus.

442
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,152
And then when I get to the resort, there are two wifi signals at each resort.

443
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:57,725
the guest, the one you can use when you come Warren, and the one for the cast members, the
people who work at Disney.

444
00:28:57,725 --> 00:29:05,950
So I'm like, I don't know how this thing's gonna behave based upon the switching of
networks, because each one has different security levels, different security, you know, to

445
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,461
do it.

446
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:11,574
And lo and behold, I did it anyway when they said not to, and me and my buddy went and did
all this.

447
00:29:11,574 --> 00:29:17,506
And we found that the switching of the Wi-Fis and the cell phones, again, 10 years ago,
did not work well.

448
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,548
We had to change things up.

449
00:29:19,548 --> 00:29:25,803
and the speeds were so completely drastically different, we had to change what kind of
data was requested at each stage of the way too.

450
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:26,884
And this stuff comes into play.

451
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:28,895
If you don't test it, how do you know?

452
00:29:28,895 --> 00:29:31,001
I mean, can you imagine, they were deploying this at Christmas, by the way.

453
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:33,933
Can you have any idea how many people come to Disney at Christmas?

454
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:39,213
Like, can you imagine if this thing broke down and all these unhappy people not being able
to get their stuff?

455
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:43,176
and all it took was me four hours to get on, you know, go to the airport, get on a bus and
drive back.

456
00:29:43,176 --> 00:29:52,655
I always find that so ridiculous when someone says we don't have time to test it because
you know there's the then I don't do you have time to spend multiple, sleepless nights to

457
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:57,422
debug production incident while it's happening like that's that's the trade off there.

458
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,150
it's like, that comes out of a different.

459
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,450
being interrupted, you know, with my family.

460
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,861
That was my motivation.

461
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:04,003
it comes out of a different budget.

462
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:08,264
That comes out of like, you know, the production budget rather than the, you know,
development budget.

463
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:08,815
Yep.

464
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:10,327
And it did, by the way, at Disney.

465
00:30:10,327 --> 00:30:12,199
had development and they had sustainment.

466
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:14,272
And sustainment was a completely different budget.

467
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,806
I'm like, why do we have such a big sustainment budget?

468
00:30:16,806 --> 00:30:20,953
Like, maybe if we did a better job up front, we wouldn't need to have so many problems in
the back end.

469
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:21,362
So.

470
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:25,322
incentives drive a lot of things in this world, especially in software development.

471
00:30:25,322 --> 00:30:36,442
And I think that's one of the things that we see now starting to cause problems in just
the organizational structure and tech companies where we're, we're somehow decided all of

472
00:30:36,442 --> 00:30:45,602
sudden you ask any software engineer, even I'll say tech lead or a software manager is
evaluating people on the lines of code, like the sheer number that they produce a good

473
00:30:45,602 --> 00:30:46,773
metric for success.

474
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:49,054
And I don't think any of them really say yes.

475
00:30:49,054 --> 00:30:52,795
I will say there are some parts of the world where they believe that the answer is yes.

476
00:30:52,795 --> 00:30:55,508
But everywhere else, I think everyone agrees that the answer is no.

477
00:30:55,508 --> 00:31:05,101
But then we see these technologies that we're utilizing and we're getting to a point where
people are being, I'm not actually rewarded, but maybe punished for not delivering by

478
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:07,833
sheer quantity as much as they have before.

479
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:14,366
And I just, I don't see the incentives growing to meet the changing world that we're in
because

480
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:23,098
Arguably, if the job, the development, the creation, the design, the testing is becoming
harder, so then is the management of those things as well.

481
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:29,826
And I just think there may be a challenge to also evolve the management of technical
resources to the 21st century.

482
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:36,919
think the way we actually look at what makes a successful, a really good developer in the
future, what makes them a good developer?

483
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:44,240
I do think at one point, probably a long time ago, when lines of code was a good thing,
mean, I'm glad I'm way past that point, but

484
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,252
In fact, I created a presentation years ago, which I keep evolving, called Readable Code.

485
00:31:48,252 --> 00:31:50,293
And I did a bunch of research on this for it.

486
00:31:50,293 --> 00:31:53,407
It used to be clean code, which was a big thing.

487
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:55,638
And I said, yo, clean code's good, but what about readable code?

488
00:31:55,638 --> 00:32:05,409
Because you think about it, and the more studies you do on this, and I think it's getting
more true today with AI, is before AI, I found a bunch of studies that show you spend 10

489
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:07,795
times the amount of time reading your code than you do writing.

490
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:10,746
You think about it, we've been lying as developers for years.

491
00:32:10,746 --> 00:32:12,486
People in your family go, what do you do for a living?

492
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:13,357
Oh, I write code.

493
00:32:13,357 --> 00:32:14,208
Do you?

494
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:15,319
Like, do you really?

495
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:22,719
Or do you just literally spend eight of your hours a day reading code that you wrote
already and kind of tweaking it and moving it around and refactoring it, make sure it

496
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:23,250
works?

497
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,721
And then with AI, AI is writing a lot of the code.

498
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:27,412
I'm okay with it writing the code.

499
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,243
I'm not gonna get rid of the reading part.

500
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:32,001
That's the part I find is we need to be there.

501
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:33,381
to make sure it's doing it.

502
00:32:33,381 --> 00:32:38,612
I want a human to be there on the line for this because the human's gonna be the one who
has to fix it.

503
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:45,714
If we're in a completely autonomous, agentized world for everything, to me, that's not,
we're so far from that at this point.

504
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:49,225
And I think it's unrealistic to put us there in the near future.

505
00:32:49,225 --> 00:32:50,876
Developers' roles are changing.

506
00:32:50,876 --> 00:32:56,447
I have no problem, so unlike what you said about LLMs writing code, I don't have problem
with any company using LLMs to write code.

507
00:32:56,447 --> 00:32:58,267
I do have a problem with them going, oh.

508
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,388
The code's been written.

509
00:32:59,388 --> 00:33:00,770
Push, go away.

510
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,943
Let's fire the developers and now let's just push.

511
00:33:02,943 --> 00:33:07,149
To me, is, I'm shocked we're not having more disasters because of that kind of stuff.

512
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:13,012
You know, I'm not as shocked because my shock level hasn't really gone down since I
entered the professional world.

513
00:33:13,012 --> 00:33:21,795
once I graduated and I went to work for a bunch of companies and I saw the code that other
engineers were writing, I was shocked that there were any systems in the world that could

514
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:22,855
work correctly.

515
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:33,771
ah like deployed software on satellites that never got an update always amazed me how
those things could run like bug free for decades even.

516
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:34,542
And I'm just like,

517
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:39,623
Wow, realistically, wow, because I look at what's generated today and I have zero faith.

518
00:33:39,623 --> 00:33:46,453
And so there is a thing where the thought is that LLMs and any sort of agentic system
raises the floor up.

519
00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:50,700
And so on average, the median is better than it was before.

520
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,013
But the expertise that went into the software development process isn't being improved.

521
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:57,684
We're not raising the ceiling in any way.

522
00:33:57,684 --> 00:34:06,752
So you still have to be, as you pointed out earlier, you still have to be at everything
that was there in the past, but people with less ability, inexperienced engineers are now

523
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:08,904
able to produce things that are slightly better.

524
00:34:08,904 --> 00:34:19,324
if I look at that perspective, it basically says, LMs don't help us produce, not just LMs,
but any sort of system built on top of them, don't help us produce better products or more

525
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,445
reliable solutions or anything like that.

526
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:25,771
But it does help people to potentially learn or, and there's even a,

527
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:35,398
Questionable answer about learning there because it was a study published by Microsoft
back sponsor about the reduction in critical thinking when you pull in Automated systems

528
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:45,504
like LLMS etc to actually do the critical thinking for you So there is a question of you
know, where exactly is the best place in the process for us to actually pull these in?

529
00:34:45,504 --> 00:34:51,587
You know, what are what we missing out in society where this is the right thing and you I
think you start off this episode basically asking, you

530
00:34:51,587 --> 00:34:52,318
What is the point?

531
00:34:52,318 --> 00:34:53,819
Where is the actual goal here?

532
00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:59,963
I love it as like a science fiction direction that we've gone where, yes, now we have
these tools that automate lots of things.

533
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:07,857
I think automation was another area where a lot of people were rightly concerned early on
that automation will take away jobs in some regard.

534
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:08,877
But there was a goal there.

535
00:35:08,877 --> 00:35:13,211
It was we can't scale effectively enough without automation.

536
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,363
And then,

537
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,223
that leads me to believe what the L.M.

538
00:35:16,223 --> 00:35:25,845
Revolution or AI revolution, whatever I want to call it, that the problem is being able to
scale, being able to deliver a factor more products or technology or software than we

539
00:35:25,845 --> 00:35:27,305
would have before without it.

540
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:31,147
And so that for me makes the question, did we need more things?

541
00:35:31,147 --> 00:35:33,547
don't think the humans ever need more things.

542
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:37,007
And if you think about it, this goes into a lesson my father taught me years ago.

543
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:39,266
The more money you make, the more you will spend, right?

544
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:40,887
You will find ways to spend your money.

545
00:35:40,887 --> 00:35:46,095
And I think we'll find ways to spend our free time as well, which is fascinating.

546
00:35:46,095 --> 00:35:47,966
I was on a panel recently about AI.

547
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:51,666
And we had some very differing opinions on where AI should be.

548
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:54,688
And one of the questions that always sticks in my head is, what problem?

549
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:55,599
does that solve?

550
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,670
Or a better way to ask is maybe a of a nastier way to ask it is, OK, you found a new AI
feature you're to go tell your friend about?

551
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,312
OK, who asked for that?

552
00:36:03,312 --> 00:36:05,903
Like, OK, sometimes we're just creating AI for the sake of AI.

553
00:36:05,903 --> 00:36:07,103
Doesn't it feel like that?

554
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:11,783
And you just pointed out, Warren, a great thing that's happening everywhere.

555
00:36:11,783 --> 00:36:14,603
I don't think we all see is that AI is being used everywhere.

556
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:16,174
Nobody knows where it should be used.

557
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,205
So what's happening?

558
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:20,916
All the companies seemingly are saying, let's AI everything.

559
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:23,516
and we'll see what things actually stick.

560
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:26,967
And I know there's more strategy behind this, but it feels this way.

561
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:34,909
And to a degree, I think a lot of the places we're seeing AI today, some of those will not
exist in the future, and others, they absolutely will and they'll double down.

562
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:41,620
And that's probably how, you know, you think about the industrial revolution when it came
about, was probably like this.

563
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,351
Let's automate everything and let's figure out what actually works.

564
00:36:44,351 --> 00:36:52,515
Okay, you know, we can actually do like conveyor belts and things like that and machines
to generate and create things, but maybe we actually still need a human to like, you know,

565
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:58,818
check quality control because want to make sure the thing we just created actually still
works like a car off the assembly line.

566
00:36:58,818 --> 00:37:00,679
I think we're going to find that more with AI.

567
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:03,651
There's got to be places that the human has to be there.

568
00:37:03,651 --> 00:37:06,563
And it's one of the reasons I love the name co-pilot so much.

569
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:10,887
And I believe it was Nat Friedman, former CEO of GitHub was one of the

570
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:13,468
creators of the co-pilot name when they first came out with that.

571
00:37:13,468 --> 00:37:15,914
it's because he's also a pilot of airplanes.

572
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:21,940
So the story goes that basically he's like, it's not someone who's going to replace your
job or take it or do the work for you.

573
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,023
It's a pair programmer.

574
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:25,474
It's a co-pilot.

575
00:37:25,474 --> 00:37:27,496
You're the pilot and there's someone next to you.

576
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,919
It's this AI tool, not someone but a thing.

577
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:31,502
And it's working with you.

578
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:33,345
And I like that model.

579
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:40,705
Because whether, know, LLMs are big a couple of years ago and, you know, and then it gets
into, we're going to do all this AI agent stuff and who knows what the next thing is going

580
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:41,496
to be.

581
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:52,878
Wherever this goes, if we relinquish the ability of the humans to be playing a major
factor in this, you know, we laugh at the whole thing of Skye and Net with Terminator, but

582
00:37:52,878 --> 00:37:55,469
really, should we be laughing at that?

583
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:57,709
Because what do we want us to be?

584
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,540
Where's our role as humans in this?

585
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,861
And I do think we need to play a big role in it.

586
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:10,108
And it's one of the reasons I love things like GitHub Copilot and yeah, you know, my team
does like Java, Python, .NET, JavaScript, et cetera.

587
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:13,609
We do a lot of different languages, but the language wars are over in my mind.

588
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:19,682
People still fight them, but I'm like, all right, I am going to use an AI tool to convert
from Python to JavaScript.

589
00:38:19,682 --> 00:38:20,152
Sorry.

590
00:38:20,152 --> 00:38:25,968
It's just, why would I spend my time learning the language, you know, so in depth that
I've already got.

591
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:28,520
when I can use a tool to help me get that foundation.

592
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,853
And yeah, and then I'll tweak it and have somebody look at it.

593
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:37,269
But those are the kind of things to me AI is good for, or generating the foundational
pieces for my new application.

594
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:38,990
You want to vibe code it to get it going?

595
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,641
Sure.

596
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,243
But then still have a process.

597
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:46,487
Use software engineering processes that have been hardened for decades.

598
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:49,778
Make sure all that stuff's there and get humans involved to work with it.

599
00:38:49,778 --> 00:38:51,310
I just think if you don't have that and like,

600
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,713
release control, version control, branching strategy, CI, CD.

601
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:57,805
These are all still very valid.

602
00:38:57,805 --> 00:39:04,091
The only thing I worry about a little bit is I worry about the idea that yes, the floor
has been raised.

603
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,712
So anybody can code now with these tools.

604
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:09,114
Yes, but I'm not a huge fan.

605
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:10,260
I'm just going to put it out there.

606
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,365
It might be contentious.

607
00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:16,908
Not a fan of, hey, put your startup idea into this tool and I'll generate everything for
you.

608
00:39:16,908 --> 00:39:17,928
And it just works.

609
00:39:17,928 --> 00:39:19,462
Trump, trust me, really.

610
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:22,671
I'm just not a fan of that.

611
00:39:22,671 --> 00:39:26,311
I like it for a starting point, but then hire somebody to actually look at it.

612
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:36,994
See, you know, I think some of those fringe things I do sort of understand though, because
if we look at the startup world, the value in the process here was sort of idea

613
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:40,224
validation, which requires the human feedback aspect.

614
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:50,349
And those companies that are switching to using either vibe coding or some sort of other
LLM to generate a lot of their code for them were potentially before needed to get funding

615
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:54,211
and then just outsource the software development to build a prototype in first place.

616
00:39:54,211 --> 00:40:05,453
Arguably I am not a proponent of outsourcing uh critical internal competency if you want
to be a technical company to like to an outsourcer to build something for you because it's

617
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:09,007
I think it's very similar to the result that we get when we use an LLM.

618
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:12,220
So I think in that regard there is a short circuit there.

619
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:21,439
But I think what you've made me realize, is that maybe the metric for value in our process
or in the output that we have is the number of human hours that have gone into it.

620
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:25,220
It doesn't matter what tools you use or how many outsourcers you use and whatnot.

621
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:31,422
The result is like internal into the company when you're building that product, whatever
tools you're using, how many hours are you putting into it?

622
00:40:31,422 --> 00:40:37,107
You don't get to short circuit that in any way because that's really the intelligent part
of the process.

623
00:40:37,107 --> 00:40:44,900
It doesn't matter how great those elements are for us as you as you point out the re i
think the reason you're thinking about having a human in the loop is because you recognize

624
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,057
that there's always something there that can never be automated away

625
00:40:49,057 --> 00:40:52,277
And I think you still have to have critical thinking skills throughout this process.

626
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:55,688
I do think that development will take a lot less time now with AI.

627
00:40:55,688 --> 00:40:57,619
Use the tools properly, it should do that.

628
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:02,639
But I don't think it goes from, you know, what once takes six months and 100 developers to
build.

629
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,024
I've been on projects that big.

630
00:41:04,024 --> 00:41:08,547
It's not going to go from six months, 100 developers down to six minutes and no
developers.

631
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:10,468
just, it's not going to do that.

632
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:15,078
And if you do that at your company, But you know, I wish you all the luck in the world.

633
00:41:15,078 --> 00:41:16,909
That's not going to be where I'm going to be.

634
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:26,239
I think this is where a lot of my faith in the innovation falls down is that I look at
these companies that are promising me some sort of tool to do a lot of work or a lot of

635
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,690
the work that I think has to be done.

636
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:37,324
And I asked them, okay, let's say I've been using your tool for five years now and I've
built a billion dollar business on it that has an incredibly complex software stack.

637
00:41:37,324 --> 00:41:38,685
What do you expect?

638
00:41:38,685 --> 00:41:42,587
the process around your tool usage to be or the architecture of those things.

639
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:46,469
If it's spec driven development, how many spec files do you expect me to have?

640
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:47,570
What do those look like?

641
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,331
What does that, like when someone needs to change something, what does that go?

642
00:41:50,331 --> 00:41:52,442
And they're like, oh, we didn't really think about that.

643
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:55,784
We were just thinking about you need to make a UI.

644
00:41:55,784 --> 00:41:59,120
And so you first do this thing and then you write this command and bam, you're done.

645
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,428
And I'm like, I don't care.

646
00:42:00,428 --> 00:42:01,039
That's like.

647
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,072
hours, 10 hours, 100 hours even to get something done.

648
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:13,724
I'm way more interested in the long-term process here and if you say, well that's going to
take like years of agent time to iterate on solving that question you've asked when you're

649
00:42:13,724 --> 00:42:15,346
at that scale, I'm like well that's not a real solution.

650
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:17,739
You haven't really solved any hard problem here.

651
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:21,695
You set up a lemonade stand and you didn't really go further than that.

652
00:42:21,695 --> 00:42:23,935
And I think some of this is user preference too.

653
00:42:23,935 --> 00:42:28,835
Like when using Git or Copilot agent mode, one of the things I like, I like it to ask me
questions along the way.

654
00:42:28,835 --> 00:42:32,706
I don't want it to go away for a half an hour and build something and give it to me.

655
00:42:32,706 --> 00:42:35,226
I want it to, know, give it the context and go.

656
00:42:35,226 --> 00:42:43,217
And if I wasn't clear on something, I want it to say, Hey, did you want this UI to have a
save button or to no save button making this up?

657
00:42:43,217 --> 00:42:44,557
Oh, oh yeah, I didn't tell you that.

658
00:42:44,557 --> 00:42:49,088
So I wanted to have a save button here because I want an explicit, you know, HP call to go
to the backend.

659
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:55,401
Okay, when using HTTP, do you want to use HTTPS or what other kind of, I want it to ask me
questions along the way.

660
00:42:55,401 --> 00:43:06,096
Now I don't want it to be a, you know, that guy who sits in the cube next to you and who's
asking you 48 questions a minute, but there's a lever and I want to be able to tune that

661
00:43:06,096 --> 00:43:07,026
with my agent.

662
00:43:07,026 --> 00:43:12,870
So it's like, and that's also part of the agent's MD for me is ask me questions when
you're not sure which way to go.

663
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,631
Before you go off on a 10 minute adventure of coding, Mr.

664
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:16,491
Agent or Mrs.

665
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:16,952
Agent.

666
00:43:16,952 --> 00:43:19,403
you know, come ask me or show me what you've done.

667
00:43:19,403 --> 00:43:20,433
Give me a demo.

668
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:21,694
Show me screenshots.

669
00:43:21,694 --> 00:43:22,936
This is my preference.

670
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:29,197
I know there's some people who I've talked to after sessions on this and workshops where
they're like, I'm totally not like that, John.

671
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:29,849
I disagree.

672
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:32,591
I want the thing to create the whole thing for me and then I'll look at it.

673
00:43:32,591 --> 00:43:34,462
So there's different ways of going about it.

674
00:43:34,462 --> 00:43:42,407
I think that's part of what we have to figure out is what is the best way for different
companies to adopt standards, which I'll come back to my main point in this whole episode

675
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:42,728
is

676
00:43:42,728 --> 00:43:44,899
Companies still need to have critical thinking.

677
00:43:44,899 --> 00:43:46,269
They still need to have processes.

678
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:47,840
They still need to have guidelines.

679
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,434
And I call them style guides because I've written these things.

680
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:54,945
Basically, it's what does your company expect from your development output?

681
00:43:54,945 --> 00:44:00,459
Not just a functional program, but do they expect these GitHub commits?

682
00:44:00,459 --> 00:44:01,999
Do they expect small PRs?

683
00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:03,721
They expect certain assets?

684
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:05,222
There's certain things that should be there.

685
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:06,497
A long, long development cycle.

686
00:44:06,497 --> 00:44:08,543
Do they expect a demo a week?

687
00:44:08,543 --> 00:44:10,395
We did that at Disney a lot, every week.

688
00:44:10,395 --> 00:44:11,557
or every two weeks it was.

689
00:44:11,557 --> 00:44:16,733
Every two weeks we'd have an iteration end and we'd have a demo to the users to say,
here's what we have so far.

690
00:44:16,733 --> 00:44:18,216
This is the feature you asked for.

691
00:44:18,216 --> 00:44:20,800
Great chance to give feedback.

692
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,878
Also makes them feel, even if everything here is no feedback, it always made them feel
good to go, all right, they got this.

693
00:44:25,878 --> 00:44:27,040
I want that from my agent.

694
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:35,944
You just made me think of this perspective that came out not too long ago that was saying
something like only 5 % of, I'll say enterprise companies that are utilizing any sort of

695
00:44:35,944 --> 00:44:39,626
AI, LLM, et cetera, are actually getting the value out.

696
00:44:39,626 --> 00:44:43,905
And I don't know how much it really went into, I mean, it's hard to justify the why,
right?

697
00:44:43,905 --> 00:44:45,915
Like why isn't that the case?

698
00:44:45,915 --> 00:44:53,861
And I can understand the perspective of those, I hate to call them vibe coders that just
say, want the tool to do everything because I think this is maybe where we disagree with

699
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:54,621
other people.

700
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:58,114
We know that the tool isn't capable of doing everything yet.

701
00:44:58,114 --> 00:45:01,407
And so we want the questions to be asked so that we can clarify them.

702
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:11,195
Whereas I can see other people, and I think that may be sort of the why that's been
propagated by these companies that are in almost a trillion dollar debt now, trying to

703
00:45:11,195 --> 00:45:16,479
justify their products creation that they can do everything because we know that they get
stuck.

704
00:45:16,479 --> 00:45:19,762
We know that there are struggles there that they just can't have the right answer to.

705
00:45:19,762 --> 00:45:20,674
There are too many.

706
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:22,888
It depends in our experience.

707
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:32,189
for it to solve that and that we know we can answer those questions for them but we have
no faith in the agents actually answering them correctly.

708
00:45:32,189 --> 00:45:34,880
Yeah, I think it's something we all have to be aware of and understand.

709
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,710
Where is AI playing a role in our lives?

710
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:46,707
And to me, AI is, I'm gonna say something I probably shouldn't say out loud too much,
which is AI is just another tool that we're all gonna learn to use.

711
00:45:46,707 --> 00:45:53,099
Just like the cloud was amazing, the internet was amazing, all these foundational changes
and shifts that were out there.

712
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:55,771
It's just as dramatic as all those changes.

713
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:57,392
Like think about how the internet came.

714
00:45:57,392 --> 00:45:58,563
That's like AI.

715
00:45:58,563 --> 00:46:03,044
We're going to be using it, but there'll be other things and our lives still go on.

716
00:46:03,044 --> 00:46:10,950
You think about when the internet came out, it opened up new doors and possibilities and
efficiencies, but we still have our businesses and we still have our jobs and we still

717
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,113
have our lives and those things still exist.

718
00:46:14,113 --> 00:46:17,325
So AI is not the most important thing in the world.

719
00:46:17,325 --> 00:46:22,118
It is a part of our worlds, which we have to figure out where does it actually fit in and
where doesn't it fit in?

720
00:46:22,118 --> 00:46:22,559
So

721
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:24,924
Feel free everybody out there to use that statement and ask.

722
00:46:24,924 --> 00:46:27,771
And somebody says, here's a new AI feature and go, who asked for that?

723
00:46:27,771 --> 00:46:31,502
I just feel like we're both going to get so many angry letters for that.

724
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:33,071
I get them all the time.

725
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:37,693
I work in an AI world and I've got to do it, but you know, at the same time, you got to be
real.

726
00:46:37,693 --> 00:46:40,240
Like AI is amazing, but it's not everything.

727
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,619
I still want to continue this conversation, but I also feel like this may be a good
jumping off point to go over to PICS.

728
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:54,919
So before we go there, I'll ask, is there any last thing, any last point of conversation,
anything that you think that we've missed that you just feel like you have to tell the

729
00:46:54,919 --> 00:46:55,421
viewers?

730
00:46:55,421 --> 00:47:00,954
Yeah, think if you're technically wise, if you're looking for something with AI, go check
out GitHub Copilot.

731
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:04,946
I guarantee you there's features that you didn't even know existed in there.

732
00:47:04,946 --> 00:47:12,711
Every time I do my GitHub Copilot sessions that I do or workshops, and people who are
using these things come to them, they find 10 new things that they didn't know existed and

733
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:13,551
can make their lives better.

734
00:47:13,551 --> 00:47:15,522
So these tools are moving so fast.

735
00:47:15,522 --> 00:47:19,428
Give it a shot, take a look at it, and check out Agent Mode, check out the CLI.

736
00:47:19,428 --> 00:47:20,454
Does a Copilot CLI?

737
00:47:20,454 --> 00:47:21,325
Some people don't know.

738
00:47:21,325 --> 00:47:22,380
Gotta check these things out.

739
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,117
They're pretty cool.

740
00:47:23,117 --> 00:47:32,025
Yeah, even if you don't go there for the copilot, I've got to say I've been on a huge kick
since the NPM security incident with the malicious packages to use dev containers

741
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:32,486
everywhere.

742
00:47:32,486 --> 00:47:36,338
And in the process of doing that, I went down the copilot route.

743
00:47:36,338 --> 00:47:45,116
And as part of that, I got to say the code completions in line, like every single time,
the first completion, always exactly what I want.

744
00:47:45,116 --> 00:47:46,067
And so...

745
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:46,899
just one at a time.

746
00:47:46,899 --> 00:47:51,202
you don't even want to engage with a model and you just want to try that out, just go and
do that.

747
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,464
And then after that, if you're done, that's fine.

748
00:47:53,464 --> 00:47:55,666
But it's definitely a great starting point, honestly.

749
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:58,688
So with that, we're going to move over to PICS.

750
00:47:58,688 --> 00:48:01,348
So John, what did you bring for us today?

751
00:48:01,348 --> 00:48:02,619
Totally non-technical.

752
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:08,130
One of the ways I keep up with everything is I used to play soccer a lot years ago.

753
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,171
And as I've aged, my body just can't do it anymore.

754
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:12,762
Too many joint issues and things.

755
00:48:12,762 --> 00:48:16,202
But keeping healthy mind and body is really important out there.

756
00:48:16,202 --> 00:48:17,673
And I've gotten into running.

757
00:48:17,673 --> 00:48:21,024
I do something called F45, which is basically just a workout program.

758
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:22,584
So I do strength, resistance.

759
00:48:22,584 --> 00:48:23,715
I do cardio.

760
00:48:23,715 --> 00:48:24,773
Find something.

761
00:48:24,773 --> 00:48:30,237
out there folks, do some kind of activity, get away from the desk, go outside, do
something.

762
00:48:30,237 --> 00:48:39,797
And my pick for all this is what got me really motivated to do this was even though I
played soccer for years, I had never run more than I'd say two miles consecutively

763
00:48:39,797 --> 00:48:41,950
anywhere, even like at a slow jog.

764
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,402
I got into Run Disney.

765
00:48:43,402 --> 00:48:46,764
Run Disney is a, you run at Disney World, exactly what it is.

766
00:48:46,764 --> 00:48:49,647
They run five case, 10 case, half marathons and marathons.

767
00:48:49,647 --> 00:48:57,361
And you do it through the parks with characters and music and all sorts of stuff going on
with tens of thousands of people.

768
00:48:57,361 --> 00:48:58,743
And it's amazing.

769
00:48:58,743 --> 00:49:01,645
If you haven't checked out Run Disney, you really should.

770
00:49:01,645 --> 00:49:03,115
It's just an amazing experience.

771
00:49:03,115 --> 00:49:07,688
A bunch of people who are totally non-competitive having a good time to run through.

772
00:49:07,688 --> 00:49:13,813
And it's helped me change my entire physical and mental and emotional well-being over the
last several years.

773
00:49:13,813 --> 00:49:15,065
And definitely check it out.

774
00:49:15,065 --> 00:49:16,165
That does sound really interesting.

775
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:25,680
I've always found my struggle with just running is that I have this internal monologue
that just sort of gets bored unless I have something else to engage with, which has always

776
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,311
sort of been a challenge for me.

777
00:49:27,311 --> 00:49:35,875
But I feel like being in a particular environment, definitely one that you necessarily
haven't been to before, definitely creates a unique opportunity.

778
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:39,633
That's where audio books can be awesome, by the way, and podcasts.

779
00:49:39,633 --> 00:49:46,285
Yeah, I mean, if you're not listening to the Adventures in DevOps podcast while you're
going for a run, mean, you missing out on a unique opportunity there.

780
00:49:46,285 --> 00:49:47,043
Exactly.

781
00:49:47,043 --> 00:49:49,205
ah Yeah, so what did I bring?

782
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:50,396
I did the lame thing, I guess.

783
00:49:50,396 --> 00:49:51,627
I brought a technology.

784
00:49:51,627 --> 00:50:00,573
uh I've been testing EarPods, different brands and companies to try to figure out what I
want to use for the podcast because I used to be using these Sennheiser.

785
00:50:00,573 --> 00:50:01,954
I'll just hold them up real quick.

786
00:50:01,954 --> 00:50:10,021
And they're really great for high quality stuff, but I don't like them interacting with me
while I'm on a call or recording.

787
00:50:10,021 --> 00:50:11,922
It's just one more thing that I'm just aware of.

788
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:13,114
So I recently

789
00:50:13,114 --> 00:50:16,926
Finally settle on these uh shocks, OpenFit 2.

790
00:50:16,926 --> 00:50:23,164
I'll just hold up with a little is, and of course it's got my magnetic USB-C charger in
it, because I love those things as well.

791
00:50:23,164 --> 00:50:24,965
They've just been absolutely great.

792
00:50:24,965 --> 00:50:31,040
They don't go in the ear, so they don't cause me physical pain after hours and hours
having them on.

793
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:37,535
I can bring them on the plane for eight plus hours when I'm traveling, and they just sit
there absolutely just fantastic.

794
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,989
And I can hear everything, Bluetooth of course.

795
00:50:39,989 --> 00:50:42,706
tried so many things and just disliked all of them.

796
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,159
You know, I use shocks for running.

797
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:46,760
I don't use the open ear ones.

798
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,882
I use the ones that wrap around your head.

799
00:50:49,283 --> 00:50:51,805
The bone conducting for the two biggest reasons.

800
00:50:51,805 --> 00:50:59,255
One is I don't like having things in my ears all day because it just, eventually it hurts
or you lose a little bit of, and the other part is when you're running, I don't want you

801
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:00,116
hit by anything.

802
00:51:00,116 --> 00:51:05,893
So having the bone conducting, I can hear everybody around me and hear my music or podcast
and they're amazing.

803
00:51:05,893 --> 00:51:08,504
Yeah, so these aren't bone conducting, but actually I can just show them.

804
00:51:08,504 --> 00:51:09,584
They don't have a piece in it.

805
00:51:09,584 --> 00:51:15,186
So they're just sitting ah actually outside my ear for a similar reason that I can hear
everything else that's going on.

806
00:51:15,186 --> 00:51:22,860
But yeah, the shocks, bone conducting one, the only reason I didn't go with them is that
it felt a little weird and I still had to turn the volume up to make it happen.

807
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:29,183
But yeah, when I exercise and whatnot, it's definitely the thing that I much prefer
because being able to hear and not get...

808
00:51:29,183 --> 00:51:37,289
Well, luckily I'm actually in Switzerland and so actually really close to Ticino, the
Italian canton in Switzerland.

809
00:51:37,289 --> 00:51:46,275
So not as many cars here, but if you're in anywhere where there are cars, it's definitely
a huge danger to go around with uh plugs in your ears.

810
00:51:46,275 --> 00:51:47,606
has saved me several times.

811
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:50,199
My wife has told me many times she worries about me running.

812
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:58,477
And I'm like, thank God I've got these bone conducting headphones because some cars,
especially, I live in Florida, so people in Florida do not know how to drive.

813
00:51:58,477 --> 00:52:01,160
And very luckily I've not been hit now.

814
00:52:01,271 --> 00:52:06,122
I think that's probably a statement that's true no matter which state or country you go
to.

815
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,973
No, people here, they don't necessarily know how to drive.

816
00:52:08,973 --> 00:52:11,904
The cars in Switzerland, they do stop for you actually here.

817
00:52:11,904 --> 00:52:16,595
So I don't know if they know how to drive, but they definitely are way more aware of
pedestrians going around.

818
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:18,837
And who's better, AI drivers or human drivers?

819
00:52:18,837 --> 00:52:21,286
Like we didn't get into that whole thing, so.

820
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:26,313
And I shudder to, at the end of the episode, open that can of worms at this moment.

821
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:32,510
uh I guess that'll be an research for the listeners to decide to go out and do uh who is
better.

822
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:37,352
And uh maybe with that, I'll say thank you, John, so much for coming on today.

823
00:52:37,352 --> 00:52:39,464
It's been an absolute fantastic episode.

824
00:52:39,464 --> 00:52:40,147
Yeah, thanks for having me.

825
00:52:40,147 --> 00:52:41,231
