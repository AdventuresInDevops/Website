Warren talks with Nathan Goulding, SVP of Engineering at [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/), about what it actually takes to run a high-performance cloud platform. They cover everything from global game server latency and hybrid models to bare metal provisioning and the power/cooling constraints that come with modern GPU clusters.

The discussion gets into real-world deployment challenges like scaling across 32 data centers, edge use cases that actually matter, and how to design systems for location-sensitive customers—whether that’s due to regulation or performance. Additionally, there's talk about where the hyperscalers have overcomplicated pricing and where simplicity in a flatter pricing model and optimized defaults are better for everyone.

There’s a section on nuclear energy (yes, really), including SMRs, power procurement, and what it means to keep scaling compute with limited resources. If you're wondering whether your app actually needs high-performance compute or just better visibility into your costs, this is the episode.
