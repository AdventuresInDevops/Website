1
00:00:01,985 --> 00:00:03,216
And we're live.

2
00:00:03,216 --> 00:00:06,937
So welcome back everyone to another episode of Adventures in DevOps.

3
00:00:06,937 --> 00:00:12,730
uh This week, uh unfortunately, my co-host is not present today.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,002
Will is off dealing with more production issues like is the norm.

5
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:23,395
uh And I don't think that's going to be any surprise to our guest who I'm super interested
to hear what he has to say.

6
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:27,507
This week, it's Nathan Goulding, current

7
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:33,094
SVP of Engineering at Vulture and with a previously long history of product and
engineering architecture background.

8
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:34,125
Welcome.

9
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,891
Thank you, Warren, it's great to be here.

10
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:47,150
Yeah, I have to say I'm pretty excited because one of the things I saw on Vulture is that,
and I hope you can give us a little bit more of the rundown here, is all about high

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,451
performance compute in the cloud.

12
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:57,133
I mean, when I think about what your company is doing, it's infrastructure on the backend,
bare metal, et cetera.

13
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:01,814
And that for me is a whole area of technology that I just really have never gotten into.

14
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:04,275
So maybe you can tell me a little bit more about

15
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:07,524
high level what they've been doing and how you got into it.

16
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,334
Yeah, absolutely.

17
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:18,154
you know, I guess maybe starting with how I got into it, you know, I actually started in
the infrastructure space back in 2001.

18
00:01:18,154 --> 00:01:24,614
And I ran a very small game server hosting business called East Coast Gaming Network and
very small.

19
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:27,126
was just out of high school and

20
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:32,250
uh One of the key features when you talk about high performance, there's many dimensions
to high performance.

21
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:40,546
Obviously, when you think about performance through some lenses, you think about high
clock speed, you think about large amounts of memory, you think about the latest and

22
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:41,917
greatest GPUs.

23
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:44,739
Another dimension to that is latency, network latency.

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,118
And in the gaming industry specifically,

25
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:58,925
Low latency is incredibly important for the gamers who are, you like, you Vulture, host
the, um, the, entire Call of Duty series and have for several decades, you know, the

26
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:00,936
latency of the end player performance.

27
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:01,316
Yeah.

28
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:02,687
Um, is, is incredibly important.

29
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:12,313
And, you know, the, the no lag, no frag is, um, you know, that's the, you know, like the,
the, thing that gets said in the industry is like lag is the ultimate killer of game

30
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:12,803
performance.

31
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:14,374
so, um,

32
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:24,907
building out a so that's how I got my start was delivering game servers uh and and it
where lag is in you know network latency is incredibly important and so You know at

33
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:25,267
vulture.

34
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:35,962
have a strong background and you know multiple decades of operating cloud infrastructure
with high performance You know end users at the end of that and so it started with network

35
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:44,522
latency, you know hosting game servers around globally for the entire like I said the
entire Call of Duty series that's really evolved into offering a wide range of high

36
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:44,536
performance

37
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:45,676
performance options.

38
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:53,516
so, you know, the thing that we really lean on is, you we talk about price to performance
or price and performance.

39
00:02:53,516 --> 00:03:00,236
One of the things that we really lean on, you know, being an independent cloud provider is
delivering better price and better performance.

40
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:05,456
So, you know, when you compare with some of the other, you know, the other cloud providers
that are out there.

41
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:14,676
so being able to do that means that at every level of the stack, whether that's compute,
storage, networking, latency, those are all

42
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:22,200
aspects where we look, what are the things that we can do to deliver a better performing
product than some of the other providers that are out there?

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,222
Because we understand that we are in a competitive landscape and we are an independent
cloud provider.

44
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:33,505
We have to make sure that we actually go above and beyond in many different areas to be
able to demonstrate that value prop to our customers.

45
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,626
that's what we are focused on.

46
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:43,167
I mean, that's actually really interesting because I've never been in software game
development and I never wanted to be.

47
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:54,205
But there are lots of questions there that, like you mentioned, uh know, Call of Duty,
that is like premier first person shooter game out there where absolutely latency is a

48
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:58,138
huge aspect to having it work effectively.

49
00:03:58,676 --> 00:03:59,570
Yeah, absolutely.

50
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,806
No, it really is.

51
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:04,918
And that's something where, you know, those are, can sometimes be your typically your...

52
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:15,521
uh Your loudest and most unforgiving customers are the ones who are in the middle of a
game and expect 100 % uptime with no latency at all.

53
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:28,404
so uh that really is the proving ground of being able to deliver cloud infrastructure in a
really robust and reliable way that these are not academic or theoretical problems that we

54
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:29,355
are solving.

55
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:34,206
These are very practical, pragmatic problems for customers who are very demanding.

56
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:40,829
So I always thought the AAA studios just ran a terrible data center in their own warehouse
and made lots of mistakes.

57
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:49,149
So I guess it's good to know that there are actually providers out there that are
dedicated to solving some of the ridiculous problems of like server management and having

58
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:54,946
dedicated servers for individual groups of uh gamers on uh at scale.

59
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:56,750
Yeah, for sure.

60
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,585
that's really, that's one aspect of what we do.

61
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:04,273
As a infrastructure provider, we are a full-fledged cloud platform.

62
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:08,420
And so when you think of Vulture, it's the...

63
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,502
oh

64
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:12,523
like modern hyperscalers is what we like to refer to us as.

65
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:20,237
We do have bare metal, which is like the lowest level of kind of like cloud infrastructure
that you can get.

66
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,268
There's no hypervisor.

67
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:30,812
You're just getting access to the raw metal and folks who value that level of performance
and single tenancy.

68
00:05:30,812 --> 00:05:33,393
Sometimes there are compliance requirements that come along with that.

69
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:38,355
uh That's an area where we can deliver that in a cloud delivery model.

70
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:49,488
you know, with the advent of a lot of the, you know, and this is not a new evolution, this
is over the last few years of these much higher level services, you know, that people kind

71
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:52,974
of forget that, especially when serverless as a...

72
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:55,714
thing became much more popular.

73
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:57,033
Gosh, what was that?

74
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:00,374
Eight or nine years ago, serverless became a thing.

75
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:05,794
You kind of as a cloud infrastructure provider, you chuckle a little bit because it still
runs on a server.

76
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:08,474
There's still a server there that runs that.

77
00:06:08,474 --> 00:06:13,694
It's just that there's so many layers of abstraction above that, that you kind of forget
about that or you don't have to think about that.

78
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:19,334
And so that's one of the unique challenges that we face, especially as I lead the
engineering team.

79
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:21,654
We're hiring engineers to build the cloud.

80
00:06:21,754 --> 00:06:22,968
And so one of the challenges

81
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:27,551
is that we face is, they're born in the cloud developers who have never been in the data
center before.

82
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:30,362
They've never accessed the lower levels of infrastructure before.

83
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:33,915
And so how do you find somebody, it's like a chicken and the egg problem.

84
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:41,389
If people assume that there is the cloud that will deploy their application and the
problem set that we're trying to tackle is how do you actually build the cloud?

85
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,922
And that's something that is unique and something that you don't find in a lot of areas.

86
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:58,196
I mean, it used to be the challenge of every company to uh requisition purchase capital
expenditures for warehouse location and build up data centers there, server blades and

87
00:06:58,196 --> 00:06:59,717
hire ops folk to run.

88
00:06:59,717 --> 00:07:04,391
And over time, we find companies specializing in every part of the stack.

89
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:16,170
And all of those experts have migrated to the cloud providers, hyperscalers uh and local
country based uh cloud options for managing that.

90
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,474
If you're interested in that, those jobs still exist.

91
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:21,699
They're just working for companies like yours.

92
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:22,632
Exactly.

93
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:24,303
No, that's exactly right.

94
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:37,029
And being able to oh find those individuals, but at the same time, because what we are
delivering is a service that allows other developers and platform engineering teams to

95
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:41,731
consume that in a really, really seamless way is, like that is the bridge.

96
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:51,555
It's the bridge between the underlying physical infrastructure and providing tools that
DevOps and platform engineering teams can consume in very native ways.

97
00:07:52,148 --> 00:08:02,054
It's a really interesting challenge to be able to do that and really, again, abstract away
the complexity and the difficulty uh and deliver on the promise of the cloud, which is

98
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:07,818
infinite amounts of infrastructure very cheaply and very quickly, immediately.

99
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:10,989
You need to be able to scale infinitely and you need to do it right now.

100
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:14,541
So it's no small challenge.

101
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:31,131
Do you find that your customers also have a challenge of dealing with burst based loads,
usually lend themselves to serverless solutions, or is it that a lot of them understand a

102
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:35,213
lot of what their expectations are for volume of requests over time?

103
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:36,414
uh

104
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:40,274
Yeah, that's a really, really interesting question.

105
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:50,579
And I think that I've seen customers fall into two kind of like primary categories with
respect to how they think about cloud infrastructure.

106
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:59,202
on the one end, have folks who understand and maybe had some sort of background in

107
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,013
delivering infrastructure in some level.

108
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:10,421
Maybe they were a platform engineer or they were an SRE or they were somebody as part of a
DevOps team and they understand, yeah, like the pieces that compose that.

109
00:09:10,421 --> 00:09:15,368
And so when they think about scaling, they think about, um,

110
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:25,423
many of the challenges that go along with scaling is, everything can, you know, can stand
it up very quickly once, but when you actually try to scale it, then you come into things

111
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:32,126
like, again, latency, and maybe in a different context here, which is how long is it going
to take for that function to execute?

112
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:34,787
Is that going to, where is that function going to be running?

113
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:36,148
Is it going to be in market?

114
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:37,678
Is it going to be in a central location?

115
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:38,969
Where are the end users?

116
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:42,591
And so the questions that get asked are typically different.

117
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:45,742
uh And then there's a class of user who

118
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,326
really doesn't think about that and also doesn't want to think about that.

119
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:51,919
And it's just unapologetic about not thinking about that.

120
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,210
It says, that is not my problem.

121
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,012
My problem is delivering the application.

122
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,514
My problem is servicing my end user.

123
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:02,538
Everything with respect to how it gets deployed, where it gets deployed, how much of it
gets deployed is your problem.

124
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:08,553
You know, either cloud infrastructure provider or some, you know, SaaS or PaaS service
that runs on top of that.

125
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:11,125
And, and so, and it's very, very unapologetic about that.

126
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:15,128
And just as this is, you know, my job is not to think about the scaling concerns that
some, that someone else.

127
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:15,990
houses.

128
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:27,828
Do you get a lot of the customers fixated on like regional based services or is there like
a fair set that's like, some want uh localization where their potential users are with,

129
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:37,174
especially like the gaming ones where you're connecting to uh maybe other players in a
local area to reduce cross player pings and increase FPS.

130
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:38,644
Are there global customers as well?

131
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:45,718
like, they don't want to think about where their users are and they still have to connect
and you're solving for problems like that in that space as well.

132
00:10:46,654 --> 00:10:48,694
Yeah, I mean, I would say that, you know, the...

133
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,092
Yeah, there's typically, you know, kind of like falls into two categories.

134
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:57,094
There is those that are location sensitive uh that say it needs to be here.

135
00:10:57,154 --> 00:10:58,565
That could be for many different reasons.

136
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:04,497
It could be because they're only serving customers in the specific market and that's going
to be the best performance for them.

137
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,589
Or there's other concerns for regulatory.

138
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:18,784
So for data governance, it has to be in the EU or it has to be in uh India or some other
location where there's specific regulatory concerns that it needs to be in market.

139
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:33,034
on the flip side, have a global software or application that needs to serve end users, um,
in, a specific area that where you're optimizing for the lowest possible latency in that

140
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:33,424
market.

141
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:43,841
And so in that case, you, you know, the, entity might be in, in wherever they happen to be
in the world, but they need to make sure that they're deploying into as many markets as

142
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:44,121
they are.

143
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:48,586
And it's not just gaming, you know, we get a ton of other customers that are in the
security space, uh, that are

144
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:55,782
the network telemetry space where they'll take one, two, maybe a handful of nodes in every
single data center that we have.

145
00:11:55,782 --> 00:12:01,787
have 32 regions, 32 uh individual data centers around the world, 32 individual regions.

146
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:09,383
They'll take one or a handful of nodes in every single one of those locations because
they're doing, let's say, eyeball network uh monitoring.

147
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:14,027
So they'll send out probes on the network and they'll do it with us and they'll do it with
a bunch of other cloud providers.

148
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:18,600
They might have hundreds or thousands of individual systems running.

149
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:31,509
in terms of their global platform as a, let's say, uh a network uh latency performance,
uptime health monitoring service, they might deploy thousands of probes around the globe

150
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:39,594
uh across our entire footprint, but across many other cloud providers' footprints,
specifically for the end purpose of monitoring the network.

151
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:46,959
so in that situation, they're optimizing for something that's very specific for the
application that's unique to them.

152
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,280
And again,

153
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:58,700
Similarly for, you know, if they're running some, you know, IOT edge network for, um, you
know, for an automotive company that has, you know, the connected cars that's, know,

154
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:08,260
again, like common use case where they might have something that's deployed into specific
markets to reach the cars that are in that specific market with the lowest possible

155
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,100
latency for, for what that is.

156
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:16,840
And it's not self-driving like, you the, the, self-driving stuff is never going to be, you
know, off the device that's going to be on the vehicle.

157
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,220
Um, that would be catastrophic.

158
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:28,057
traffic, uh but for other pieces of connected car where you do have it off device, then
you're going to want to have that in the region that the cars are operating in.

159
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:30,266
jumping into the controversial topics already.

160
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:36,286
Before I get into that one, I'm really interested to know how you manage to figure out
where to place your edge location.

161
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:43,426
So do you have different types of data centers or are all of them pretty much equivalent
as far as capabilities that they offer?

162
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:53,906
I can imagine the size and maybe the individual resources may be different depending on
actual need and where the customers are, but are they fundamentally treated the same?

163
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:56,326
Like if we look at AWS or GCP,

164
00:13:56,391 --> 00:14:02,891
They don't offer every service in every region and they also don't offer a data set in
every country.

165
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:14,331
So you may be in a place where you have users who want to utilize your vulture to serve
their customers and there may not be any localized resources there.

166
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:17,822
How do you figure out where to put the edge nodes and what do those actually look like?

167
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:23,446
Yeah, you know, it's that's a really fantastic question because edge means different
things to different people.

168
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:25,650
And, you know, in when.

169
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:35,525
edge computing first was a thing, you know, a years ago, um, or several years ago, people
thought that edge computing was, you know, there's going to be a data center at the bottom

170
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:36,752
of every cell tower.

171
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:39,356
and that was, you know, kind of a thing for, for a minute.

172
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:49,381
and kind of like pushing the boundaries of edge because, know, if you look at the
evolution of data center footprint over time, it was all the major metros were the hubs

173
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:50,882
for data centers.

174
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:54,223
and, and, and the reason for that was just, there was density.

175
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:55,564
You have all the major financial.

176
00:14:55,564 --> 00:15:02,679
markets, had all the major tech technology companies, they were all in these regions and
people wanted to have data centers that were in those major regions.

177
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:13,796
So New York, the Bay Area, uh Ashburn, Dallas, there's some major Chicago, there's major
metros where there's just, if you look at the US, the density of those data centers there,

178
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:24,523
and then started to branch out into regional operators to go into other places that were
still major metropolitan areas, but not kind of like uh tier one cities in the US.

179
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,464
uh

180
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:33,844
And then it kind of like skipped over like rapid expansion to, and now we're to put one at
the end of, know, at the bottom of every cell tower.

181
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:40,784
Um, and that, know, like, you look at the cost of capital to deploy at the bottom of every
cell tower, as, an example, it just doesn't make sense.

182
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:44,844
If you have, you know, I'm, looking, you know, I'm streaming a YouTube video in the car.

183
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:55,204
Um, and you know, I'm passing one cell tower, you know, and it'll, only connected to that
tower for, know, for, for two to three minutes as I'm driving down the highway, the amount

184
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:55,596
of.

185
00:15:55,596 --> 00:16:03,156
that I'm processing over that network is just never going to recoup the cost of putting
building the data center and installing servers there and, having, you over the network

186
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:07,556
delivery of things like self-driving cars is, is, you know, just a safety disaster.

187
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:12,816
so, you know, you're looking at how much data actually needs to get processed at the far
edge.

188
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:15,676
Um, and so, and it's just, it's just not that much.

189
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:20,936
Um, you know, so, so, but then, and then you, you like enter GPU.

190
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,236
It's like, okay, wait a minute.

191
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:25,300
So now there's a bunch of edge data centers, which aren't

192
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:32,645
in the cell tower, know, aren't at the base of cell towers, but they are edge data centers
in so far as they might be in the middle of a wind farm in South Dakota.

193
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:33,936
And it's like, well, what are they doing there?

194
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:41,611
They might be like mining crypto as an example, where there's access to very cheap power,
but you're going to have concerns in terms of redundancy.

195
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:50,207
like, are they, know, like optimizing for cost is different than optimizing for redundancy
and resiliency, which is what you're going to get if you're, you know, operating a data

196
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:52,999
center that's delivering, you know, services to the financial services industry.

197
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:54,419
It's just like a different tier of service.

198
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:55,160
ah

199
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,840
And so you have a bunch of data centers that pop up in like the far edge, it's a different
far edge, but also out there as well.

200
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
We don't have any of those.

201
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,120
are focused on major markets.

202
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,580
That's where we do have 32, but they're in all the major markets that are around the
world.

203
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,040
And so the things that we look at are the common things like population density.

204
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,280
look at obviously customer demand.

205
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,780
If somebody needs us to show up in a specific location for a specific reason, we'll do
that.

206
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,980
And so we're really focused on being able to deliver

207
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,043
services to places where there's a need there.

208
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:42,632
uh so our data centers are not, uh again, like we didn't grow up uh having data centers in
the middle of nowhere that were then trying to retrofit with backup generators and with

209
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:49,736
better network performance because they suddenly have a different value add in terms of
the industry that they're going after.

210
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:54,992
are, again, they're tier three plus data centers, which is uh like one

211
00:17:54,992 --> 00:18:00,517
of the high, there's four tiers and tier three plus is like, you one of the best.

212
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:10,836
so, ah so, so yeah, these, these are like high, you know, like, I can't remember the, I've
lost count of the number of nines that it offers, but, um, these are again, like they're,

213
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:15,476
major and all the major, um, like name brands, you know,

214
00:18:15,476 --> 00:18:17,627
data center providers are the folks that we work with.

215
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:22,990
uh that's because our class of customers, they're enterprise customers.

216
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:30,114
They expect a certain thing in terms of the uptime of these services and the network that
they're gonna get there.

217
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:40,493
So are you seeing that your customers and potentially this outer market segment of
customers that you're not necessarily geared to right now are leaning towards more hybrid

218
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:50,920
model over time or, and they bring their own local data center or already built server
rack and they're connecting that up to your cloud or are you offering something to be able

219
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:59,456
to build that connection so that those customers who may not have data center expertise,
like I can think in AWS, there's like some sort of deployable outposts for instance for

220
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:00,134
running

221
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:05,102
tech on is there some corollary that you've got or see customers actually interested in?

222
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:10,406
Yeah, you know, that's another really, really great question.

223
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:11,888
I think that...

224
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:23,719
You know, the, the AWS Outpost, I think has, you know, seen somewhat limited uptake, um,
you know, because if you ha if you have an on-prem data center, um, you know, think that

225
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:33,474
when cloud went through the first wave of explosive growth, people assumed that everything
was going to go to cloud and that on-prem was going to go to zero.

226
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:42,340
Um, and, and the reality is, that when you're deploying, you know, when you're flipping
capex to op-ex, so instead of buying servers, you're paying, you

227
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:54,010
OPEX, you know, your depreciation schedule for your, capex, um, you know, you like from a
financial perspective, you recognize that if you're going to be in the cloud and at this

228
00:19:54,010 --> 00:20:02,246
point, everybody understands that they're going to need infrastructure in some fashion,
that if you're going to be in the business of having infrastructure, cloud infrastructure

229
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:11,253
in some form, either delivered on-prem through your on, you know, your, your platform team
combined with your onsite team, or if you're just consuming it, through the cloud that

230
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,024
you're going to

231
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:14,336
going to need it over a long period of time.

232
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:23,232
And so those charts cross at about the three year mark for most people in terms of the
costs of the TCO.

233
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:31,318
And so if somebody is saying, hey, we're going to need this infrastructure, we're planning
to be in business for the next two to three or four decades, then they're going to say

234
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:37,602
it's going to be way more cost effective for us to own this gear, understanding that...

235
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:48,078
You know, the, the lines cross at about, you know, three years or so, but the useful, the
actual useful life of those systems is probably somewhere between, I don't know, six,

236
00:20:48,078 --> 00:20:49,558
seven, eight years probably.

237
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:58,598
And so if you have the, you know, so a CFO is going to look at that and say, Hey, like we
should be doing that, you know, putting servers and data centers because it's going to be

238
00:20:58,598 --> 00:21:00,558
more cost effective for that asset.

239
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,798
There's other challenges that come along with that because now you have to have a team.

240
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:07,792
You have to either have the team already, or you need to hire the team and you

241
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:11,615
to do a lot of things that people don't generally do as part of their business.

242
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:15,099
mean, when was the last time that you were inside of a data center?

243
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:17,241
It's like, ever?

244
00:21:18,168 --> 00:21:27,772
I was lucky early on in my career and I managed to get in one because the company I worked
for uh offered global manufacturing services.

245
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:31,284
And so they would put a data center within each of the manufacturing plants.

246
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:34,685
And ah there's a lot of stories that go on there.

247
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:42,568
One's like, you probably don't expect to have to deal with a flood or a fire or having
bolted the same time very close to where your data center is.

248
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,199
And that being like a critical problem.

249
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:47,245
So just reliability of that thing.

250
00:21:47,245 --> 00:21:54,799
Is is another challenge there like I actually feel like hiring, you know, that's obviously
one of the issues But there's just like so many in the list goes on and on for instance

251
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,229
correct projections, right?

252
00:21:56,229 --> 00:22:07,515
Like how many of us were like, yeah, you know uh six years ago, know, what's gonna be so
different around the world like sands whether or not any sort of uh LLM or AI.

253
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:09,686
Yeah, I brought it up and we're only I like the 20-minute mark.

254
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:10,446
Um

255
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:16,816
ah is good, accurate, or useful, I do feel like it's impacting a lot of companies.

256
00:22:16,816 --> 00:22:25,404
And that's something that I can guarantee you very few ah financial experts put into any
of their market predictions or for their companies.

257
00:22:25,404 --> 00:22:34,063
So yeah, I mean, if you have a perfect understanding of how much money you're going to
spend and how much, like what your accounts receivable is going to be going forward, your

258
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:34,533
revenue.

259
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:35,238
ah

260
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:36,918
and where you can capitalize on that.

261
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:37,758
Yeah, go for it.

262
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:38,898
Make those purchases.

263
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:41,138
But I guarantee you, no one is that good.

264
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:46,318
And if you are that good, just quit your job and go put some money in the stock market
right now.

265
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:51,718
When I say that, sure the correct buy is like shorting the market by any amount.

266
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:56,078
That's probably how a bunch of people are going to become rich in the next couple of
years.

267
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:58,549
I've never had too much luck for that.

268
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:04,072
feel like the moment that I decide that I'm going to make a bet, it feels like gambling to
me.

269
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:05,379
I'm going like, I'm going to short sell.

270
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:07,654
then that will be the moment that it's the bottom of the market.

271
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:12,141
I'm going to stick with delivering infrastructure as my day job.

272
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,572
incredibly wise and right thing to do.

273
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:17,293
ah Yeah, for sure.

274
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:21,062
There are so many analysts out there that statistically they're just going to...

275
00:23:21,062 --> 00:23:22,235
They only do this.

276
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:31,219
My brother was telling me when he was uh working for a mutual fund that literally there's
one person at that company and all they do is focus on five companies specifically.

277
00:23:31,219 --> 00:23:31,720
That's it.

278
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,660
That's all they know.

279
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,993
So there's no way that you're going to have more information or be more of an expert to be
able to make better decisions in them.

280
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:41,224
You're pretty much betting against everyone else who has also no idea.

281
00:23:41,224 --> 00:23:43,655
So maybe you're more lucky than them.

282
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,767
If luck is on your side, definitely go for it.

283
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:50,709
But for amateur investors, definitely any sort of market index fund.

284
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:59,514
If you're feeling risky and you want to be like, you know what, I want to either have
nothing or everything, then you take the gamble, like you said.

285
00:23:59,766 --> 00:24:00,966
Exactly.

286
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:07,186
Yeah, I'll never put money, you know, make my own bets there because it truly feels like a
bet.

287
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:15,406
feels like, you know, in the way that I approach that is, you know, I only would bet the
money that I'm willing to lose, which is very little.

288
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:21,186
I would prefer to do things that I can control and have some knowledge over.

289
00:24:21,186 --> 00:24:25,446
So, but yeah, you know, getting back to your original question about

290
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,315
about the hybrid models and how customers are viewing that.

291
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:36,276
think that ah that's an area where I think that there's certainly folks who have...

292
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:38,837
you know, again, like putting them into kind of two categories.

293
00:24:38,837 --> 00:24:43,289
There are folks who are clouds only, and there are those that are hybrid.

294
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:44,810
And we see both of those.

295
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,092
And I think that having a strategy that accounts for both of those is really important.

296
00:24:49,092 --> 00:24:56,976
And so I think that it would be a mistake to think that everything is ultimately going to
end up in the cloud because that has not been born out.

297
00:24:56,976 --> 00:24:59,827
And I don't think that that will continue to prove out.

298
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:06,290
But cloud is an important strategy and an important thing for a lot of even those
customers

299
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,061
who are traditionally on-prem.

300
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:14,446
And I've worked at both of those places that uh have a hybrid strategy because that's what
they need.

301
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,836
They need cloud for the burstability.

302
00:25:15,836 --> 00:25:19,769
They need it for instant access to because they can't make a prediction of their capacity.

303
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,570
They need to have a hybrid strategy.

304
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:27,694
uh But they just simply either can't or don't want to be fully in the cloud.

305
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:32,837
And so having a strategy, a technical strategy that can account for that is, I think,
really important.

306
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:34,311
Yeah, no, I'm totally with you.

307
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:36,882
My advice has always been make the mistake in going to the cloud.

308
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:40,453
And then 10 years later when you're like, well, you know, it would have been better if we
didn't.

309
00:25:40,453 --> 00:25:49,073
Then you can start being like exactly figuring out how you want to move some of your stuff
back on-prem unless you have a lot of old hardware sitting around that you're just like,

310
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:57,258
oh, I want to throw a bunch of extra money at maintenance, which is the thing that I
thought about when you said having the data centers at the bottom of every cell tower.

311
00:25:57,258 --> 00:25:59,459
It's not even like having to...

312
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:08,464
spend the money to go and build them there or the complexity of building an application
that handles like lossy packets, like not meeting anywhere because you're in between

313
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:09,244
switching.

314
00:26:09,244 --> 00:26:17,989
I mean, you think about how reliable GPS cellular networks are, like it's very difficult
to get your position in some places in the world just due to jamming and whatnot.

315
00:26:17,989 --> 00:26:20,461
And now you have to deal with not like unreliable technology.

316
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:22,832
And then it's gonna break down, right?

317
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:26,788
Just having one of those at every single cell tower, that's a lot of extra maintenance.

318
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:34,547
that you're going into it more so than like, how do you even send a person there, you
know, in a truck with the right equipment to go and investigate and then ship thing.

319
00:26:34,547 --> 00:26:36,809
Like a lot of those are in places that are very difficult to reach.

320
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:41,804
You know, there's pretty much just one cable that's going to the tower and no one ever
goes to that tower ever again.

321
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:43,686
Exactly.

322
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:45,746
No, that's very true.

323
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:54,484
And again, like you also, you these are running on, know, like if there's, you if you lose
utility power, you know, you're operating on a generator and...

324
00:26:54,484 --> 00:27:01,580
You know, I do have a UPS power bank, you know, for my home internet to ensure that it's
up all the time, but it lasts about eight minutes.

325
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:10,888
And, you know, and for the cell tower, you know, with the very low power, you know, the
things that are running there are typically, you know, they're arm chips for low power

326
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:16,173
consumption, the switching, like all of that is, you know, it's all low power devices.

327
00:27:16,173 --> 00:27:21,698
Even the, you know, the signal, I mean, they have to broadcast the signal, but you've got
maybe, you know.

328
00:27:21,946 --> 00:27:27,238
is somewhere between eight and 24 hours of redundancy of the current cellular
infrastructure that's there.

329
00:27:27,238 --> 00:27:37,853
Then you start tacking on kilowatts of server compute and you have much different
challenges if you lose utility power or if something goes wrong.

330
00:27:39,754 --> 00:27:48,669
When that happened, the assumption was, and I think the other aspect of that, again, going
back to high performance, low latency, the other aspect of that is that, what is the use

331
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,959
case that requires that low level of latency?

332
00:27:51,752 --> 00:27:57,572
operating 32 data centers around the world, it's 32 and there's, know, tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands of cell towers.

333
00:27:57,572 --> 00:27:58,332
Like what's the difference?

334
00:27:58,332 --> 00:28:00,552
Like what, what, what, what do you actually need that for?

335
00:28:00,552 --> 00:28:09,972
Because we already operate, you know, our, our platform, you know, 32 we operate and we
are able to reach, I think it's 90 plus percent of the world's population under 40

336
00:28:09,972 --> 00:28:10,892
milliseconds.

337
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:20,572
That's like, like, so like what's the use case that necessitates that you drop from 40
milliseconds down to, you know, two or one, there are those, like there's again, like

338
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:21,656
financial services, have.

339
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:23,756
Like, you you're not dealing in milliseconds.

340
00:28:23,896 --> 00:28:26,176
You're dealing in a unit much smaller than that.

341
00:28:26,176 --> 00:28:35,416
Um, but that's in a very specific location that they, like the global application use case
of insanely low latency has yet to be born out.

342
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:43,956
And I think for a, for a minute there, was like, self-driving cars, of course, but you
know, pushing that over the network, over the, you know, the EM spectrum with jamming and

343
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:47,536
with everything else that's going on again, it's just, you know, a safety disaster.

344
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:51,586
so, um, that, that was like the use case that everybody trotted out when that

345
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:57,158
was when that was a hot topic, but uh that has not really, again, been worn out in
reality.

346
00:28:57,158 --> 00:29:07,902
And that the use case where you need high amounts of compute at that minuscule latency to
necessitate a deployment like that, again, we've yet to see that.

347
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:09,668
Yeah, I mean, I'm with you there.

348
00:29:09,668 --> 00:29:18,431
I mean, we'll see for real time decision making having that on vehicle for autonomous
vehicles would make way more sense.

349
00:29:18,431 --> 00:29:28,534
I mean, we already see this needing to be the case for any sort of on on person missions
uh outside the atmosphere for our planet.

350
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:34,865
So we're already thinking about this as a as species of how to build technology like this
and what is actually necessary.

351
00:29:34,865 --> 00:29:37,487
But I have seen an uptick in companies

352
00:29:37,487 --> 00:29:39,288
that are trying to provide remote services.

353
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:49,972
So rather than having full autonomous vehicle, just have the driver is somewhere else,
like is sitting at their desk, driving your vehicle to the actual location.

354
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:54,274
And so with that, I can see a little bit more of a use there.

355
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:57,965
I could see maybe it's backed up by redundant systems within the vehicle.

356
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:06,176
So the person who's in the car, like you still don't have to drive the vehicle, but I do
see these uh as long as there's some differentiation in

357
00:30:06,176 --> 00:30:13,444
the markets around the world being financially viable to outsource the driving to someone
else somewhere else.

358
00:30:13,657 --> 00:30:14,478
Yeah.

359
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:14,818
Yeah.

360
00:30:14,818 --> 00:30:19,098
I mean, I think that that it's, it's a super interesting one to, to talk about.

361
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:30,518
Cause I think that there are, you know, again, whether it's somebody driving your car for
you or, um, you know, missions, um, you know, in other parts of the world that, um, you

362
00:30:30,518 --> 00:30:34,766
have an operator sitting somewhere, you know, those are.

363
00:30:35,078 --> 00:30:41,482
those are valid use cases, but the, the reality is, that the electromagnetic spectrum is
open to anyone.

364
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:47,826
And so, and I don't mean open in so far as ES, like, you know, you have to encrypt it, you
have to worry about it, but anybody can.

365
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:51,930
You know, has access to both broadcast or receive those signals.

366
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,359
It's open.

367
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,331
Obviously it's regulated.

368
00:30:53,331 --> 00:31:00,438
Um, you'd be in a lot of trouble if you broadcast over part of the spectrum that you were
not authorized to broadcast over.

369
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:04,596
Um, but it would be extraordinarily disruptive if somebody did knowingly.

370
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,352
So it's, it's, it's an attack factor because it is an open spectrum.

371
00:31:07,352 --> 00:31:15,441
mean, anybody can, you know, buy commodity parts and assemble, an electromagnetic, you
know, something that either, you know, sends or receives over the electromagnetic spectrum

372
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:17,152
in the frequencies that these would operate in.

373
00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:17,982
so there.

374
00:31:17,982 --> 00:31:26,898
to be the ability for either that, like if you take like somebody driving your car
remotely, like that sounds great, but if that signal gets jammed or if that signal gets

375
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:34,053
dropped, there needs to be something on the device either in the form of somebody has to
be sitting behind the wheel or the car needs to stop itself and then coordinate it between

376
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:38,065
the other cars to stop themselves without causing an accident.

377
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:47,944
But that the medium in particular, if it's wired or if it's fixed in place, there's things
that, you know, there's a relative amount of assurity around what's happening to the

378
00:31:47,944 --> 00:31:50,266
to stop it because it's fixed or it's wired.

379
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:52,748
so the redundancy of that is so much better.

380
00:31:52,748 --> 00:32:00,744
But we all see, you know, you know, the electromagnetic spectrum is already
extraordinarily crowded uh and is only getting more congested.

381
00:32:00,744 --> 00:32:08,571
And it is also open to interference and jamming in ways that a wired network is, you know,
doesn't suffer those things.

382
00:32:08,571 --> 00:32:17,688
So it presents unique challenges to be able to solve, to be able to do that in a way that,
you know, is safe and, you know, and it counts for the

383
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:21,433
reality of the medium by which this information gets transferred.

384
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:30,801
So if you're making an autonomous car company and you need to send signals between each of
the vehicles and some, you know, primary data center, Vulture is probably the answer is

385
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:31,992
what I'm hearing.

386
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:35,746
Yes, I guess that's, getting back to Vulture.

387
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:35,886
Yes.

388
00:32:35,886 --> 00:32:38,166
No, that would be, that would be the way to do it.

389
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,546
Uh, as if you need a, uh, a locator data center.

390
00:32:40,546 --> 00:32:42,126
mean, this is, but this is also true.

391
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:48,586
Like this is actually what we do with connected cars, which I will also say like the
connected car, you know, use case is, is totally valid.

392
00:32:48,586 --> 00:32:51,370
It's not for maybe necessarily like driving the car, but

393
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:54,201
You know, mean, on my device itself right here, I can talk to my car.

394
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:54,762
can unlock it.

395
00:32:54,762 --> 00:32:55,342
can lock it.

396
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:56,702
can see, it moving?

397
00:32:56,702 --> 00:32:58,290
Where it's the, what's the location?

398
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,644
I can set the climate control.

399
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:10,369
So there are things that are like for non-critical communication between the vehicle and
the end user or the cloud is, is a totally valid use case for sure.

400
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:17,672
It's, only when you, so, you know, when you have, you know, human lives that are being
transported in a vehicle that, know, it could be potentially deadly is when you say, okay,

401
00:33:17,672 --> 00:33:20,043
maybe like, let's not do that over the network.

402
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:21,304
but certainly for things that.

403
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:26,104
that are with respect to how you start the car or lock it remotely.

404
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:34,464
Those are all things where connected cars are super valid use case where, and we see that
all the time where it's like, and that's also the valid, like if you're doing a connected

405
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:45,604
car in Asia or in Australia or in India, like there are, or in the US, those are all areas
where having a data center that is in market is incredibly important.

406
00:33:45,604 --> 00:33:51,364
Like that's an area where you only get goodness from being able to deploy close to where
the end users are.

407
00:33:52,401 --> 00:33:53,432
Makes a lot of sense.

408
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:54,472
I do have to ask.

409
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:56,451
So, you know, I'm running a company.

410
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,856
I don't think that high performance computing is something that we need.

411
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:09,242
uh But are there telltale signs that I should be thinking about the infrastructure that my
product, my company is utilizing differently?

412
00:34:09,242 --> 00:34:20,169
Are there certain things that I could like ask myself potentially, you know, the audience
that is listening to this right now, something for them that would help identify that just

413
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:22,350
using a regular cloud provider or

414
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,665
doing something on-prem like may have a better alternative.

415
00:34:27,146 --> 00:34:37,556
Yeah, you know, think that the uh being able to uh look at the, I guess I should also say,
you we, if you just want access to easy access to.

416
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:39,907
large amounts of compute around the world, Vultr is a great fit.

417
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:49,211
So, you know, that we have all the SDKs, so like cluster API and Terraform and, you know,
it's API first, anything that you can do in the portal, can do via the API.

418
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:52,183
And so, you know, we've, again, it's like been battle hardened with developers.

419
00:34:52,183 --> 00:34:59,296
That's a huge part of our origin story and the DNA of this company is being able to serve
developers and DevOps individuals and teams.

420
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:02,588
That's really, that's a core part of what Vultr is all about.

421
00:35:02,588 --> 00:35:07,093
And so, ah so yes, there's a piece of performance, but it's also ease of use.

422
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:07,860
You know, if you

423
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,533
you work with some of the hyperscalers, it's incredibly complicated just to get something.

424
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:16,786
I mean, I guess they've made saying kind like the onboarding process easy so you can click
the button to get going, but they're incredibly complicated.

425
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:22,810
You look at some of the hyperscalers and you look at like the IAM or...

426
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:30,354
like resource hierarchy models of how permissions get structured and it almost seems
impossible to set up a new service or it's like, wait, why is this throwing me an error?

427
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:34,434
I'm the root user and I can't even deploy this new thing that I want to try out.

428
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:41,854
Or when I add my second user, I put these accounts together, how the policies get things
like, you know, all the services of how you do networking and there's 10 different kind of

429
00:35:41,854 --> 00:35:44,714
gateways that you can all stitch together in very different ways.

430
00:35:44,714 --> 00:35:51,690
Like there's incredible complexity with when you are at one of the hyperscalers, which,
you know, we are focused on.

431
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,471
kind of distilling that down into what is it that you actually need.

432
00:35:54,471 --> 00:36:01,184
And so I think there is the performance piece of it, which is says, you know, how can I
get better performance at a better price?

433
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:07,057
It's not like apples and oranges where, you know, it's like, well, it's less expensive,
but it's also cheaper and smaller.

434
00:36:07,237 --> 00:36:09,598
this is like better for less.

435
00:36:09,598 --> 00:36:13,355
ah And then also the ease of use component of that.

436
00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:14,331
How do we keep it simple?

437
00:36:14,331 --> 00:36:18,212
How do we distill these things down to say like, I just want some compute, like I just
want a Kubernetes cluster.

438
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:19,623
I just want some object storage.

439
00:36:19,623 --> 00:36:21,624
ah How can I deliver that to

440
00:36:21,624 --> 00:36:31,687
the end user in a way that is uh easy to consume and they can actually enjoy the process
of getting it without having to think about, you know, okay, like I am an individual or

441
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:34,028
I'm a developer or I have a small team.

442
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:40,590
Like I'm not a giant enterprise that has multiple business units and multiple
organizational units with different cost centers and different billing accounts.

443
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:46,212
I don't, I shouldn't need to think about that every single time I go to deploy like my
next instance.

444
00:36:46,212 --> 00:36:50,874
so that's like, if there's, you know, challenges and...

445
00:36:50,998 --> 00:36:54,758
Consuming things at the hyperscalers where it's like, why is this so complicated and hard?

446
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:56,858
Like, then you, and then you look at the bill, you get the bill at end of the month.

447
00:36:56,858 --> 00:37:04,058
And it's like, wow, I didn't realize that I needed a PhD in finance and accounting to be
able to understand my cloud bill.

448
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:15,218
Um, that's, that's an other area where, you know, like I was recently looking at a, at a
bill from one, uh, you know, from a potential prospect, um, that was coming from a

449
00:37:15,218 --> 00:37:19,938
hyperscaler and they were getting charged $8,000 for configuration.

450
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:20,952
Um, this is literally.

451
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:28,672
objects in the database that are getting charged $8,000 for, uh, like usage based, number
of hours per config item, um, inside of the database.

452
00:37:28,672 --> 00:37:32,052
And, and I was like, that's a really interesting, I mean, that's a fantastic business
model.

453
00:37:32,052 --> 00:37:39,732
I would love it if, if, know, like, if everybody, mean, I guess with your hyperscale,
you've just kind of chosen that that's an okay, an acceptable thing, but typically like

454
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:45,252
the administrative aspects of what you're delivering as a infrastructure provider or as a
SaaS service is just, it's baked in.

455
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:47,032
like, it's the cost of doing business.

456
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:50,872
But if you, if you like looked closely at your bill, it's like, wow, I didn't.

457
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:52,956
on the small scale, it's like, okay, well, okay, that's fine.

458
00:37:52,956 --> 00:37:56,118
They charged me $13 for my configuration objects and I have a lot of them.

459
00:37:56,118 --> 00:37:57,069
That's fine.

460
00:37:57,069 --> 00:38:02,273
But imagine spending $8,000 on a uh month on configuration objects.

461
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:04,455
That was just how my cloud got configured.

462
00:38:04,455 --> 00:38:15,023
So like there's areas where if you look at like the many different ways, like we don't
charge for requesting like S3 requests and like that's a huge cost for on AWS.

463
00:38:15,023 --> 00:38:17,004
It's not just you're going to just getting charged for the storage.

464
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:18,826
You're getting charged for requesting it.

465
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:20,728
That's another area where like keeping it simple where it's like,

466
00:38:20,728 --> 00:38:24,948
you're going to get charged, you know, per terabyte per month for the storage that you
use.

467
00:38:24,948 --> 00:38:28,468
And we're not going to nickel and dime you on, you know, all these different areas.

468
00:38:28,468 --> 00:38:37,668
so, so there's a lot, I mean, yes, there is again, like there's the performance piece of
it, but there's many other areas where, um, people are, you know, are kind of tired of the

469
00:38:37,668 --> 00:38:42,628
ways in which the hyperscalers do business and, and want, they want an alternative.

470
00:38:43,118 --> 00:38:44,598
No, I'm totally with you.

471
00:38:44,598 --> 00:38:58,519
I think that one thing at least from an AWS standpoint has been that it's try to provide
the as granular understanding as possible so that you can optimize as much as you want

472
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,100
based off of what they're providing.

473
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,291
But I feel like it's sort of a leaky abstraction.

474
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:07,935
You can sort of figure out how they built their service based off of how they're charging
because it's so transparent.

475
00:39:07,935 --> 00:39:11,237
And it doesn't necessarily help because it has a lot of complexity there.

476
00:39:11,238 --> 00:39:12,472
I think

477
00:39:12,472 --> 00:39:16,704
we found a similar problem when we built our own service.

478
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:24,868
uh We offer auth as a service and part of that is realistically all of our competitors
charged by like monthly active uh users.

479
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:27,649
And it's like, well, what if your users aren't like monthly active?

480
00:39:27,649 --> 00:39:29,660
What if they're, you know, use once and whatnot.

481
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:36,734
And so trying to come up with a single metric that handles every single use case and is
easy to charge and understand has been really important.

482
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:37,636
Whereas

483
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:44,445
I feel like you will see this where there's like some primary metric and then there's like
five other metrics that are like, but if you do this, it's like another charge.

484
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:45,937
And if you do this, it's a third charge.

485
00:39:45,937 --> 00:39:47,618
Like that doesn't help anyone.

486
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:49,232
Exactly.

487
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:51,246
No, it's very true.

488
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:53,450
And I think that ah

489
00:39:53,450 --> 00:40:00,683
Yeah, I think that when you have, like when you sit around a room, when you have the
opportunity to sit around a room and just come up with different ways to charge people for

490
00:40:00,683 --> 00:40:09,667
using the platform and extracting value from it, you can come up with very many creative
ways to add on, know, tack on different ways to, to, um, to charge customers.

491
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:14,640
And, and that's something that also, I mean, we've been doing this for, you know, Vulture
for over a decade.

492
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,692
And it's kind of remarkable that we have been able to keep it as simple as we have.

493
00:40:18,692 --> 00:40:23,384
and I think that's a testament to being able to focus on, you know, providing fundamental
cloud.

494
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:29,884
infrastructure to a tech enabled, you know, mid to large tech enabled enterprise and SaaS
companies.

495
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:39,264
And that's, you know, that that gives us the ability to really focus on, you know, focus
on making sure that it's simple, easy to consume and without having to introduce all these

496
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:41,284
ancillary ways that people get charged.

497
00:40:41,284 --> 00:40:42,544
it's, easy to understand.

498
00:40:42,544 --> 00:40:48,764
It also just makes our lives easier when somebody comes in and says, Hey, you know, can
you please digest my, you know, my, bill from a hyperscaler?

499
00:40:48,764 --> 00:40:53,304
And we are able to look at that and say, great, like all of these just is a big red, you
know, like big.

500
00:40:53,304 --> 00:40:57,264
X mark, just that's, you're just not going to get charged for that.

501
00:40:57,264 --> 00:41:02,384
And people look at that and they say, they think, oh, wow, I didn't even realize that that
was an option.

502
00:41:02,384 --> 00:41:05,104
I just thought that this was the way that it was.

503
00:41:05,104 --> 00:41:07,844
And being able to provide an alternative to that is really powerful.

504
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:15,543
Yeah, I mean, there's actually a great book out there called Platform Revolution, where it
actually talks about if all of your customers need to hire a third party consultant to do

505
00:41:15,543 --> 00:41:19,555
something, then you have an opportunity to recapture that value within your own platform.

506
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:29,679
And so I think the other hyperscalers fail at that, where there's huge successful
businesses out there in that regard that are trying to just explain your cloud bill.

507
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:36,542
it should tell you, no, we should probably do something a little bit smarter ah with how
we're actually providing that.

508
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,859
It just makes tracking so much easier for everyone.

509
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:39,887
Yeah.

510
00:41:39,887 --> 00:41:40,117
Yeah.

511
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:42,307
Well, it's much easier to add than it is to remove.

512
00:41:42,307 --> 00:41:51,880
found, um, you know, it's, it's, you know, be, being able to add more, know, but what you
cut and how you cut or how you create things that make it simpler is often, you know, as

513
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,050
often as difficult because.

514
00:41:54,231 --> 00:42:01,673
You know, the, the, that complexity typically gets added for either well-intentioned
reasons or because somebody said that that was a requirement.

515
00:42:01,673 --> 00:42:06,074
Um, and so it got added and now once it's there, it's very, very hard to unwind.

516
00:42:06,288 --> 00:42:12,364
Hopefully no one's adding features because someone said it's a requirement without
actually backing it up with good justification.

517
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,965
I just can't imagine that's happening in the real world.

518
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:26,477
There is this good quote that I'm totally gonna misattribute uh that perfection is not
when there is nothing more to add, but nothing left to remove.

519
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:30,782
So I think that definitely applies to having a good billing strategy.

520
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:31,756
I love that.

521
00:42:31,756 --> 00:42:33,406
Yeah, that's very, that's very, very true.

522
00:42:33,406 --> 00:42:34,365
I love that.

523
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:40,038
I will I do want to ask I feel like we were dancing around this a little bit ah since you
are building data centers.

524
00:42:40,038 --> 00:42:41,790
How does.

525
00:42:44,472 --> 00:42:56,129
Sort of research and analysis go into the requirements and understanding of like where to
place the data center geolocation base like um any sort of potential issues catastrophic

526
00:42:56,129 --> 00:43:05,114
wise to impact the data center and I you know the part that's really interesting for me is
what sort of attention to security of like physical security of the data center.

527
00:43:05,114 --> 00:43:06,404
Any thoughts there.

528
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:10,957
Yeah, you know, there's many things that go into that.

529
00:43:10,957 --> 00:43:14,378
um And, um you know, we, I mean,

530
00:43:14,378 --> 00:43:20,391
We also, I should say, we work with a lot of fantastic data center partners who do a lot
of that work for us.

531
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:31,026
And so, uh we typically don't go out and procure land and do construction, m but we do
work with our data center partners to go through that assessment.

532
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:43,791
And there's many things that go into that, especially as, if we wanna unwrap the presence
of AI and GPU, there are many things that go into that, especially around

533
00:43:44,264 --> 00:43:47,324
the advent of the AI boom that's been happening.

534
00:43:47,324 --> 00:44:00,124
so access to power, access to reliable power, access to multiple sources of large amounts
of power is one of the, I guess, one dimension.

535
00:44:00,184 --> 00:44:10,584
The other aspects that go into that is, okay, well now if you're delivering a lot of that
power into a very small space, you have to cool it because there's a ton of heat.

536
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:14,168
so, you know, things like, you know, like the just like things that have

537
00:44:14,168 --> 00:44:21,072
evolved over the last few years from air cooling to liquid cooling to other things like
rear door heat exchangers.

538
00:44:21,113 --> 00:44:29,168
It's like a hybrid where it's like liquid cooled to the ship, know, DLC, but you know,
there's other components that still generate heat.

539
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:31,850
And so you'd have some fans that will go to a rear door heat exchanger.

540
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,961
So there's a bunch of different things that go into that.

541
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:40,845
um And so the, ah like where you specifically do the data center is, know,

542
00:44:42,366 --> 00:44:45,887
There's many things that go into that.

543
00:44:46,048 --> 00:44:56,592
And then once you have it, you're talking about, in some cases, situations where what
you're deploying into a single data center is...

544
00:44:56,813 --> 00:45:02,065
And this is true across both power footprint and across networking.

545
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:07,358
And one of the things that just is fascinating about what has happened is that you have...

546
00:45:07,976 --> 00:45:20,893
right now, a moment where in a single location, you could be deploying more power than you
might have for a GPU footprint, than you might have across an entire global footprint of

547
00:45:20,893 --> 00:45:23,734
CPU, which is really incredible.

548
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:25,996
And you have that also at the network level too.

549
00:45:25,996 --> 00:45:30,691
If you look at some of the larger clusters that we've deployed, uh

550
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:36,895
The GPU fabric, is, you know, the GPUs effectively get connected via networking on the
backend.

551
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:42,088
So you have like front-side networking, which is like my public IP and you have like
backend networking for GPU fabric networking.

552
00:45:42,088 --> 00:45:43,158
uh

553
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:54,098
If you look at some of the larger clusters, the amount of aggregate throughput that you
have in a single cluster is more throughput than the entire internet in a single cluster.

554
00:45:54,098 --> 00:45:56,838
And there's multiple clusters that are getting deployed.

555
00:45:56,838 --> 00:46:06,138
that, like, if you look both for power and for networking, you're, and then you're
deploying them on a time scale where like it's, you know, 2025, like it took how many

556
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,798
decades of the internet growth to get to where we are.

557
00:46:08,798 --> 00:46:13,232
And now if you look at what's going to get deployed, you know, what just got deployed last
year and what's going to get deployed.

558
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:15,083
over the course of the next one or two years.

559
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:22,378
It's really this incredible volume of, we just, it took us this long to develop the entire
internet with all of the CPU cloud.

560
00:46:22,378 --> 00:46:32,575
And now it's like, we're going to be deploying what is, you know, 10 or a hundred or a
thousand or 10,000 X the power networking on a much shorter time scale.

561
00:46:32,575 --> 00:46:39,549
And that has, I mean, just as an observer, it is incredible to see what's being deployed.

562
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,811
As somebody who also deploys that it is,

563
00:46:43,052 --> 00:46:46,454
know, it's presented challenges that I've never seen before in entire career.

564
00:46:46,454 --> 00:46:53,098
And so that's been really, really fascinating to witness, both again, as an observer and a
participant.

565
00:46:53,254 --> 00:46:53,974
I mean, that's interesting.

566
00:46:53,974 --> 00:47:02,377
mean, I think we've known for a long time that waste heat is still like 50, 60 % of costs
of data centers, possibly higher or lower.

567
00:47:02,377 --> 00:47:04,925
But you know, it's a huge amount to have to deal with that.

568
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:08,598
It's not the compute or human resources or physical resources.

569
00:47:08,598 --> 00:47:21,608
um But the other thing that really comes to mind is, at this point, I wonder if you're
already getting to the point where you're identifying concrete competition for the

570
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:33,369
the power, the actual energy to power your data centers with the other hyperscalers or
whether or not it's still seen as a limited resource for the moment or whether or not this

571
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:37,642
is uh an actual question that's come up and a concern that you have to start dealing with.

572
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,977
No, I it's always a concern.

573
00:47:39,977 --> 00:47:40,248
Yeah.

574
00:47:40,248 --> 00:47:50,800
I mean, I would say that the, again, access to power, uh, large quantities of power and,
um, you know, relatively small densities is for sure an issue.

575
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:57,006
Um, and we all face it, you know, and I would say this, um, you know, there's, uh,

576
00:47:58,592 --> 00:48:00,609
There's a planning cycle to that as well.

577
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:05,664
mean, everybody understands that it's not an unlimited resource, but that I think that
honestly predates.

578
00:48:05,974 --> 00:48:09,594
you know, GPU, like there's always the fallback to utility power.

579
00:48:09,594 --> 00:48:18,114
Uh, and maybe there's a special, you know, special agreement that you have with, you know,
utility power, but data center providers, you know, have to have guarantees.

580
00:48:18,114 --> 00:48:23,854
And so that's always taken the form of, you know, contractual obligations, you know, for,
power delivery.

581
00:48:23,854 --> 00:48:30,954
And this is no different, although because of the scale it, it, you know, where the power
generation comes from and the time scale in which to deploy it, you know, has introduced

582
00:48:30,954 --> 00:48:32,054
different things.

583
00:48:32,194 --> 00:48:35,988
um, you know, data centers have never really been just like, oh yeah, just like plug it
in.

584
00:48:35,988 --> 00:48:39,902
outlet and you're good, it's always been, there's been a little bit more to that.

585
00:48:39,902 --> 00:48:51,253
So yeah, that has always been a special consideration and I guess more so now, just more
like the time piece of ensuring when that power is going to show up so that you can

586
00:48:51,253 --> 00:48:53,485
coordinate things on the backend.

587
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:54,895
No, it makes complete sense.

588
00:48:54,895 --> 00:49:05,660
I'm sort of wondering whether or not you're taking into account your like, where data
centers by other hyperscalers out there are putting their data centers because you could

589
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:09,112
end up with a conflict of, you know, a scarce resource.

590
00:49:09,686 --> 00:49:18,066
Yeah, no, mean, certainly there's, you know, we definitely look at that.

591
00:49:18,066 --> 00:49:28,202
I typically the way that that shows up is that there's going to be a certain amount of
power, you know, 10, 20, 50 megawatts of power that gets...

592
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:29,923
delivered through a contractual obligation.

593
00:49:29,923 --> 00:49:35,425
And so that would be over some number of years or decades to be able to do that.

594
00:49:35,425 --> 00:49:38,327
And that's kind of like reserved power capacity.

595
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:49,852
ah And so that's just, you like you reserve that capacity and that, like, if you're going
to say, you know, if you're going to, let's say there's 20 megawatts that is available in

596
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:58,436
Cleveland or in Cincinnati or in, you know, South Dakota somewhere, like that's just in,

597
00:49:58,448 --> 00:50:01,009
that becomes available and then whoever takes it takes it.

598
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:09,012
so that is, uh and in some cases people are in the market for additional capacity.

599
00:50:09,012 --> 00:50:13,046
In some cases they say, well, we just took down 30 megawatts and...

600
00:50:13,046 --> 00:50:13,566
Pittsburgh.

601
00:50:13,566 --> 00:50:15,086
And so we're fine.

602
00:50:15,086 --> 00:50:23,206
And so we don't need that 20 that just showed up over, you know, in the Midwest, but
there's 10 other people that were chopping at the bit for the power that was in

603
00:50:23,206 --> 00:50:23,506
Pittsburgh.

604
00:50:23,506 --> 00:50:27,606
And so, you know, now there's, you know, if there were 10 people that were in Pittsburgh,
one of them got satisfied.

605
00:50:27,606 --> 00:50:34,026
Now there's nine people that are going to, that might be interested in the 20 megawatts,
you know, in Cleveland, just as a simple, simple example.

606
00:50:34,026 --> 00:50:37,006
So, and that also fluctuates with the demand of the end customers.

607
00:50:37,006 --> 00:50:43,000
And so depending on, you know, who's, who's, you know, who's buying it on the backend, you
know, the,

608
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,253
uh that will influence the band.

609
00:50:46,253 --> 00:50:50,246
And so in some cases there's opportunities that are being chased.

610
00:50:50,246 --> 00:50:55,391
so folks might be asking about the same, for the same end customer coming out of different
angles.

611
00:50:55,391 --> 00:51:00,595
And so it's a really, it's a super dynamic time, super dynamic market.

612
00:51:01,176 --> 00:51:08,441
And so we're always assessing what's available based on our own needs and our end customer
needs as well.

613
00:51:08,506 --> 00:51:11,268
mean, it sounds like it's not a struggle yet.

614
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:21,713
I mean, obviously there are ins and outs and complexities in contracts and future
prediction for demand needs, but it sounds like at the moment, there's still positive

615
00:51:21,713 --> 00:51:24,274
optimism for what's available.

616
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:29,518
sure, you may not be able to build a data center in one location, but uh picking another
one is still an option.

617
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:37,366
ah I'm wondering when when the, I'll say craze of power usage, uh

618
00:51:37,366 --> 00:51:47,447
spikes even more whether or not that will actually drive innovation in the sciences to
complete the years old fusion research that it looks only like China at the moment is

619
00:51:47,447 --> 00:51:49,630
actually sufficiently invested in.

620
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:58,615
Yeah, I've seen every so often I get articles that all come across my newsfeed that talk
about breakthroughs and infusion.

621
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:04,807
And I've seen several of them over the last even 12 months or so.

622
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:15,510
And so I think that it's gonna be, I mean, I think there's maybe one other alternative
that has more of a practical.

623
00:52:16,306 --> 00:52:26,631
implication, but SMRs, is uh small, I think it's small modular reactors, it's nuclear
power, but it's on a much smaller scale.

624
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:38,096
m I think even, I think Equinix announced that they were uh investing some number of
millions of dollars into SMRs as an alternative.

625
00:52:38,096 --> 00:52:46,220
m And the US has not been a leader in renewable nuclear power, m whereas the EU has

626
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,961
made lot of advancements over the last couple of decades.

627
00:52:48,961 --> 00:53:05,765
If you look at the cycle of nuclear waste and how you kind of process that and can ensure
there's uh a healthier, like our strategy to nuclear waste is to bury it in the ground,

628
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:08,306
which is, that's a choice.

629
00:53:08,306 --> 00:53:09,994
m

630
00:53:09,994 --> 00:53:12,476
But there's other choices that have emerged.

631
00:53:12,476 --> 00:53:22,534
so I think that innovations in the nuclear space is something that's really fascinating
because you're able to have access to without a lot of the carbon footprint and fossil

632
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:26,968
fuels and unrenewable energy sources.

633
00:53:26,968 --> 00:53:33,833
It's really, really compelling, but you do have to think about the complete picture for it
to be a sustainable method.

634
00:53:33,937 --> 00:53:36,128
I do want to get an energy expert on the show now.

635
00:53:36,128 --> 00:53:41,951
I will say that burying it in the ground is still better than putting it in some other
places.

636
00:53:42,272 --> 00:53:53,078
And I think the idea of, I think it's switching to thorium over the uranium yellowcake
from uh the 258, I think is, there are innovations.

637
00:53:53,078 --> 00:53:56,760
ah I don't know if I have your optimism about what Europe is doing.

638
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,663
ah There is progress, not as much as I would really like.

639
00:54:02,009 --> 00:54:13,760
you know, it's really interesting and I am not an expert on it because I think there was,
uh I think if I'm remembering correctly, Germany was, you know, like on the brink of uh

640
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,820
this kind of like renewable.

641
00:54:15,894 --> 00:54:18,914
cycle and there's a name for it that I'm forgetting.

642
00:54:18,914 --> 00:54:20,954
But then they announced that they were going to shut it down or something.

643
00:54:20,954 --> 00:54:22,274
And I just remember thinking about it.

644
00:54:22,274 --> 00:54:31,334
was like, but that, like you were on like the brink of like getting to the point where we
all wanted it to get to, which was, you know, more of a, I think from a technical

645
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:37,834
perspective, they were, they had made more advancements, even though I think there was
some policy that prevented it from coming to fruition.

646
00:54:37,834 --> 00:54:44,720
Whereas I, and I don't know that those, those translated over here, but maybe you, maybe
you have some more, more insight into that than I do.

647
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,870
Well, I'll share what I know.

648
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:50,512
uh So facts, ah Germany definitely did shut down all their nuclear reactors.

649
00:54:50,512 --> 00:54:55,533
uh The interesting thing is they had been promised to be decommissioned for over a decade.

650
00:54:55,533 --> 00:55:02,855
And other countries faced with the same similar challenges, crises that we're facing,
said, you know what, let's stop our decommissioned process.

651
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:13,758
uh Part of the challenge in Germany was a lobby from the coal miners associations because
there's a lot of jobs associated with that.

652
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:20,467
that still has a huge impact in many countries switching over to realistic renewables.

653
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:32,304
Actually, in the last two decades, one of the hugest impact to switching to fission
reactors, so what we are calling nuclear, is other quote unquote, green renewable energy

654
00:55:32,304 --> 00:55:32,724
sources.

655
00:55:32,724 --> 00:55:40,739
Like the lobby against uh fission and nuclear by solar and wind is like outstretched
ridiculously.

656
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:41,929
It's just so sad.

657
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:42,964
uh

658
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:43,418
Yeah.

659
00:55:43,418 --> 00:55:45,181
This is probably not the podcast to go into that.

660
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:56,258
So I'm going to stop there and maybe I'll say, there's one last thing about Vulture you
wanted to share, can close it out with that.

661
00:55:57,558 --> 00:56:03,963
Well, so yeah, look, I would say maybe closing it out, uh getting back to cloud
infrastructure and DevOps.

662
00:56:03,963 --> 00:56:10,299
uh I think one of the things that we say is that Vultr is the platform for platform
engineering team.

663
00:56:10,299 --> 00:56:17,006
So uh DevOps and platform engineering is your jam or you find that that's an area where
you're doing a lot of it.

664
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:22,399
I think that Vulture has a really compelling platform that is uh something that you'll
enjoy working with.

665
00:56:22,399 --> 00:56:30,033
It has the, again, uh compelling price, compelling performance, uh and an ease of use
attached to that with a global footprint.

666
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:34,745
so that checks a lot of the big boxes for DevOps individuals and platform engineering
teams.

667
00:56:34,745 --> 00:56:40,718
And so if that's something that resonates, uh definitely check us out and let us know what
you think.

668
00:56:41,154 --> 00:56:42,185
I love the sales pitch.

669
00:56:42,185 --> 00:56:47,218
will I will ask because I'm sure someone will be wondering like what's the interface that
you're providing?

670
00:56:47,218 --> 00:56:48,930
Is it you know some custom APIs?

671
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:57,044
Are you providing ah like some sort of Kubernetes adjacent replacement for the control
planes etc?

672
00:56:57,044 --> 00:56:58,316
What does that look like?

673
00:56:59,234 --> 00:57:01,955
So yeah, it is, uh you know, it's API first.

674
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:06,287
So if you use Terraform or cluster API, you'll feel right at home.

675
00:57:06,287 --> 00:57:11,660
have providers for cross-plane, we have providers for cross-plane cluster API Terraform.

676
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:17,603
so, uh yeah, so like full API deployment, there is feature rich portal as well.

677
00:57:17,603 --> 00:57:27,007
uh so, but that, you know, typically is going to be the entry point is going to be one of
those like, you know, we have a GoVulture, Golang library.

678
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:29,048
So one of those entry points for API is probably

679
00:57:29,048 --> 00:57:30,359
going to be that.

680
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:33,212
We do also have VKE, which is the Vultra Kubernetes engine.

681
00:57:33,212 --> 00:57:41,894
So this is vanilla Kubernetes and uh is something that is kind of directly, instead of
running Kubernetes yourself, which is totally fine.

682
00:57:41,894 --> 00:57:45,683
You can run Kubernetes on VMs or bare metal yourselves if that's your jam.

683
00:57:45,683 --> 00:57:53,189
m But if that's not your jam, you can consume Kubernetes VKE from us and we'll run it for
you.

684
00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:55,639
No, that's good to know.

685
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,410
Not my jam.

686
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:00,456
ah And uh I don't know how many people would pick it personally.

687
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:04,283
I think I'm gonna keep my opinions across playing to myself for this episode.

688
00:58:04,283 --> 00:58:06,866
I think that's...

689
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:15,881
I will say, I was going for a walk the other day and uh there was a fire hydrant and
attached to the fire hydrant was a series of...

690
00:58:16,314 --> 00:58:19,936
to piping and tubes connecting down to a little water faucet on the end.

691
00:58:19,936 --> 00:58:23,799
And it just kind of reminded me of Kubernetes a little bit, where Kubernetes is the fire
hydrant.

692
00:58:23,799 --> 00:58:33,826
And then to deploy your applications, just like the little water faucet, it can be really
overkill sometimes to be like, wait a minute, why am I needing to do this?

693
00:58:33,826 --> 00:58:35,727
And just to get this little web application going.

694
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:39,702
uh But it is, yeah, if that's a...

695
00:58:39,702 --> 00:58:47,886
Yeah, if deploying something that's a little bit easier is attractive, then yeah, we can
do that for you.

696
00:58:47,886 --> 00:58:57,990
We actually had a Kubernetes consultant, expert consultant come on a few episodes ago, and
I'd highly recommend that episode for anyone that's interested in the different ways of

697
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:01,222
deploying to cloud providers uh with your technology stack.

698
00:59:01,222 --> 00:59:05,774
Okay, so with that, let's move over to picks.

699
00:59:05,774 --> 00:59:10,556
So my pick for today is, uh I don't know if I'm gonna be lame, but I like this.

700
00:59:10,556 --> 00:59:15,878
There's a show on YouTube and Nebula called Jetlag the Game, and it's...

701
00:59:15,962 --> 00:59:18,263
They have a couple of different game versions.

702
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:28,747
play tag within like a small area like multiple countries involved or capture the flag uh
in uh in Japan or in a larger area.

703
00:59:28,828 --> 00:59:39,292
Basically trains, planes, buses are involved in game playing and they even have a card
game version where you can play with your friends like in an actual live physical

704
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:40,352
location.

705
00:59:40,352 --> 00:59:44,547
So there's lots of there's like lots of episodes that they do about three or four seasons
a year.

706
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:45,999
And it's absolutely fantastic.

707
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:55,551
think it's like if you hated the reality show race around the world or amazing race, ah
this is so much better.

708
00:59:55,551 --> 01:00:01,269
This is like actual high quality, uh like game relevant stuff.

709
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:03,371
There's no real tricks involved.

710
01:00:04,032 --> 01:00:04,643
That's awesome.

711
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:05,243
I love that.

712
01:00:05,243 --> 01:00:13,023
um Well, would have to, my pick of today, I would have to say there's a TV show called
Money Heist.

713
01:00:13,023 --> 01:00:22,504
And I'm not sure if you're familiar with this, um it's on Netflix and it's a show about,
it's an incredible psychological...

714
01:00:22,504 --> 01:00:24,114
um

715
01:00:24,114 --> 01:00:29,487
It's every single, the first season, it's every single episode, believe you, uh wanting to
watch more.

716
01:00:29,487 --> 01:00:33,778
It's in Spanish, so don't get the dubbed version, do Spanish with subtitles.

717
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:35,379
But it is phenomenal.

718
01:00:35,379 --> 01:00:38,961
And I don't want to give too much away, but it's called Money Heist.

719
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:50,786
if you watch the first, if you can get through the first episode, ah it's incredibly
smart, well done uh about uh a heist in uh the uh central bank of Spain.

720
01:00:50,786 --> 01:00:52,847
And so it is fascinating.

721
01:00:52,847 --> 01:00:54,018
uh

722
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:58,099
Love it and if you haven't seen it check it out money iced

723
01:00:59,204 --> 01:01:08,406
You know, I feel like I watched something that was like a single episode of, and I don't
know if it was this, of They Abducted Someone.

724
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:10,439
And I don't know if that's what this was or something.

725
01:01:10,439 --> 01:01:12,418
Anyway, so it sounds like it's interesting.

726
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:12,898
few seasons.

727
01:01:12,898 --> 01:01:14,338
Yeah, there's a few seasons.

728
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:18,538
And if you caught it in the middle, probably was, you know, it might've been.

729
01:01:18,538 --> 01:01:23,278
There's many things that happened in that season.

730
01:01:23,278 --> 01:01:28,458
it is really, it is one of the smartest TV shows that I've watched in a while.

731
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:33,278
And it's entertaining, but it's also really, really well done.

732
01:01:33,558 --> 01:01:37,960
And yeah, and not a lot of people have heard of it.

733
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:49,685
Somebody recommended it and watched the whole thing and was one of those shows where I
think we all have them right, where you just get to the end of the episode, you're like, I

734
01:01:49,685 --> 01:01:56,107
really have to, I've got an early morning meetings in the morning, I have to stop
watching, just, really don't know what happens next.

735
01:01:56,268 --> 01:01:59,099
It's really, really smart about how they do that.

736
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:01,350
And yeah, I really highly recommend it.

737
01:02:02,192 --> 01:02:04,323
It's sleep sacrifice worthy.

738
01:02:04,323 --> 01:02:07,184
ah It sounds like a great pick.

739
01:02:07,184 --> 01:02:07,904
Thank you, Nathan.

740
01:02:07,904 --> 01:02:14,687
ah So I just want to say thanks again for coming on the senior vice president of Vulture
here with us.

741
01:02:14,687 --> 01:02:17,008
And it was a great episode.

742
01:02:17,008 --> 01:02:21,049
And uh thank you all the listeners and viewers for staying around.

743
01:02:21,049 --> 01:02:23,990
And we'll catch everyone next week.

744
01:02:24,618 --> 01:02:25,775
Thanks so much, Warren.

745
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:27,688
Yeah, of course.
