1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,201
So Warren, what's been your experience with SRE?

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:14,480
That's quite the way of just jumping into the episode and I was so unprepared because I'm
not even the guest for today's episode so I don't have an answer to that question

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,491
honestly.

4
00:00:15,596 --> 00:00:16,787
Yeah, for sure.

5
00:00:16,787 --> 00:00:18,960
Jillian, what about your thoughts on SRE?

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,415
You're just like you're a contract, not just a contractor, you're a contractor, you just
light stuff on fire.

7
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:26,738
And then if they want to put out you bill them for it, right?

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,450
I really, I just need to make sure data doesn't get deleted, because that's a problem.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,354
That is a problem, OK?

10
00:00:33,354 --> 00:00:37,893
And that's really all that I worry about in terms of any kind of reliability.

11
00:00:37,893 --> 00:00:40,581
you can't be exploited if there's no data left.

12
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:42,753
I mean, that's true.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:52,413
say that there is a book out there published by one of the hyperscalers, I believe, ah
that attempts to define it in their own terms.

14
00:00:52,413 --> 00:01:01,195
But I feel like a lot of things they do, it's used as a introduction into the topic rather
than used as experts.

15
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:07,227
So I'm really interested to hear what our guests today will be sharing with us.

16
00:01:07,404 --> 00:01:14,421
Well, yeah, which is a great segue because clearly we need some expert opinions on SRE.

17
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:17,584
And so we've got Amy Knight with us.

18
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:19,386
Amy, welcome to the show.

19
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,313
Hey, happy to be here.

20
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:23,080
I'm excited to have you here.

21
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:28,974
tell us a little bit about your background and how you got to SRE.

22
00:01:29,143 --> 00:01:32,983
Sure, yeah, I love SRE.

23
00:01:33,383 --> 00:01:35,983
It's a little bit of a love-hate relationship.

24
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:40,043
It can be very stressful at times, but I also love it.

25
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:43,883
I feel like it is kind of...

26
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:57,563
When I I and this I'll get into kind of like my path into SRE and m it just it really
suits I feel like my engineering brain perfectly and the high level there is I come from

27
00:01:57,563 --> 00:02:12,440
non-traditional background so self-taught did the whole boot camp thing 12 years ago now
which is insane to me I'm really old or feel really old like I saw someone on Twitter the

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,041
other day talk about like what

29
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,592
did you use before Git?

30
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:21,907
And I was like, my gosh, I'm really old now because my first job I used Mercurial, which I
guess is Git.

31
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:24,421
at the same time, yeah.

32
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:26,327
ah

33
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:32,847
But anyways, so backing up, and I used to do JavaScript Jabber.

34
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:41,207
So I kind of started off in JavaScript land, did Node and Frontend.

35
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:45,427
I kind of focused heavily on Frontend for a little while, did Node as well.

36
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:56,707
And then I think it was like 2018, 2019, I went to work at NPM, which was like my dream
job at the time.

37
00:02:56,741 --> 00:03:01,544
until they got acquired and you know, it's just a little bit of a bummer because it was
very short-lived.

38
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:12,832
uh But when I was there, we did cross-functional teams and my manager at the time was
like, you seem really interested in like this platform, SRE work, infrastructure.

39
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:19,947
uh We can probably hire for a web developer more easily than we can hire for that role.

40
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:21,058
Do you want to go over to that team?

41
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:22,689
And I was like, yes, sign me up.

42
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:26,281
Like you want to, you know, if I have the opportunity to

43
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:27,882
learn a new skill on the job?

44
00:03:27,882 --> 00:03:29,243
Like, yes.

45
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:33,886
So I did SRE at MPM for a while.

46
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:45,393
And then I did most of my SRE work at Paramount Global, which is like the streaming
application, and did two Super Bowls there.

47
00:03:47,015 --> 00:03:49,517
The last year's Super Bowl.

48
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:52,689
And so that's kind of my journey into SRE.

49
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:56,143
And why I say it is like, I feel like SRE is

50
00:03:56,143 --> 00:04:00,545
really like my perfect niche in engineering.

51
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:11,469
And that is because coming from this non-traditional background, I've always been the
programmer who is like, sure, that new tech is really fun and interesting, but shouldn't

52
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:14,811
that be something we're working on on the weekends on our own time?

53
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:19,662
Isn't our job, I hate saying this because people hate me.

54
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:20,855
you

55
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:25,555
the day, like, I'm just like, I feel very fortunate to have a career in tech.

56
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:35,135
And in the back of my mind, I'm always like, my job, whether I like it or not, like if I'm
working hours, my job is to make this company profitable.

57
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:45,075
And while I love programming for fun on my own, like I have a responsibility to the
business to make make the business profitable, keep it alive.

58
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:48,475
I've worked in a lot of startups, so I understand this.

59
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:50,849
And that's where SRE really fits in, because

60
00:04:50,849 --> 00:05:02,304
it's like a lot of roles, yes, you're accountable to the business, but I feel like in an
SRE role through we can get into like SLAs, SLIs, SLOs, but the SLAs like you are

61
00:05:02,304 --> 00:05:07,336
accountable to the business stakeholders and that is your overarching goal.

62
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:12,029
So basically in a nutshell, SRE site reliability engineering.

63
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:15,660
I also call it like production readiness engineering.

64
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:19,769
It is your task to keep the application running.

65
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:20,809
ah

66
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:25,574
optimally for as much of time as possible.

67
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:34,841
So what I heard was that you at MPM had so much work and were doing such a great job that
they're like, here's more work.

68
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:40,873
Be responsible for the success of the business and not just solving tickets and pushing
out features.

69
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,929
Hahaha

70
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:53,197
Yes and no, but honestly, truly like my manager there, he was absolutely amazing as were a
lot of the people that I worked with, like absolutely brilliant, talented people.

71
00:05:53,197 --> 00:06:03,766
And I don't know, I'm like distributed systems nerd, like on the weekends, I like to watch
YouTube videos of distributed systems interviews.

72
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:12,482
Like I don't know why this is very interesting to me, ah but I've always like just
gravitated towards that sort of thing.

73
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:14,428
You don't have to shame yourself for that.

74
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:19,794
think lots of us on the weekend, yeah, we're watching interviews and other tech things.

75
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:20,957
Yeah, for sure.

76
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:29,112
Whenever there's like a big outage of like a big tech company I'm always like reading the
postmortems and trying to talk to them like talk about them with my husband and he was

77
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:34,506
he's just like He tries to act interested, but he's just like what's wrong?

78
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:36,327
He's like I love how nerdy you are.

79
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:39,729
I'm like, okay, I'll just talk to myself

80
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:51,576
You got to really, um I think that's a super interesting point where you talked about you
were working on JavaScript development and then you went over to SRE.

81
00:06:51,576 --> 00:07:03,671
And I think that's a really important skill to have for that because as the SRE, it's not
just about the infrastructure or the data dog metrics or whatever.

82
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:05,983
A lot of times you've got to.

83
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:11,616
dig into the code and discover what's actually going on here.

84
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:19,537
um So how do you feel like those web development skills set you up for success as an SRE?

85
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:21,099
Yeah, that's a really good question.

86
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:36,423
And I, it's a common question I get from people who are also interested in SRE because,
and I also feel like, you know, backing up a little bit, SRE, I know Warren mentioned like

87
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:42,509
the Google SRE book, but I also feel like this focus on SRE really came about via
microservices and buzzword.

88
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:45,357
I hate saying them, but it is what it is.

89
00:07:47,753 --> 00:08:03,013
But so to kind of answer your question there, I feel like the teams that I've been on, not
necessarily NPM, but Paramount specifically, they had a lot of like systems engineers,

90
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:05,273
like the team was very system engineer heavy.

91
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:11,653
So a lot of these people who like worked in data centers and those are all obviously very
valuable skills as an SRE.

92
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:18,942
But where they were really lacking was like the programming side of things, application
development side of things.

93
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:26,241
And I feel like to have a really good SRE team, you do need a mixture of both and you can
really like learn from each other.

94
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:32,145
So in the SRE, like in SRE roles that I've been in, I am doing some programming.

95
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,705
I mean,

96
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,073
You need to be able to debug the program.

97
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:41,210
You're also doing some programming in, you're doing like scripting.

98
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:47,899
A lot of SRE, I don't think people realize is a lot of caching at the edge.

99
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:54,185
And so you're doing a lot of custom logic that gets deployed to your CDNs and things like
that.

100
00:08:54,185 --> 00:09:03,064
So while it might not be as intensive as building out a feature and stuff like that, you
still need those programming um concepts to write that kind of code.

101
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:05,896
And then also to work with the developers because...

102
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:15,585
you know, for better or worse, is like, that's like the, that's the telltale like thing
that people say about SRE is like that push and pull between the engineering department

103
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:18,918
because they have a vested interest in getting their stuff out to production.

104
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,424
And then SRE has a vested interest in keeping the system healthy and functioning.

105
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:28,874
for I mean, you did mention that it could be different in different places.

106
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:32,528
So like from your experience, what has being an SRE really meant?

107
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:34,291
Like, is there a standard day?

108
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:38,967
And I know that's a terrible question for asking any sort of engineer or technical person.

109
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:44,433
But you know, some expectations around what the role is that you were doing both at NPM
and Paramount.

110
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,799
Yeah, so MPI, obviously, like a very relatively small team.

111
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:55,462
m just we had the SRE team and there was a lot of like I said, it was cross functional.

112
00:09:55,462 --> 00:10:01,165
So we were tasked with building out features, but the team was like a cross functional
team where we had a platform engineer.

113
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:03,426
We had SRE infrastructure engineer.

114
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:14,771
uh We had a application developer and all working together to get something out to
production and like the SRE side of things there would be like I was saying, uh

115
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:17,873
I talk about SRE in terms of production readiness.

116
00:10:17,873 --> 00:10:29,701
So making sure that this feature is ready for production if there are like dashboards that
need to be made, making sure that those are in place so that we can properly monitor when

117
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:39,991
it goes to production, making sure that you have the proper resources for the machines
that it's going to be running on, uh things like that.

118
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:42,555
At Paramount, em

119
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:48,913
you know, that's a much larger, MPM has a very large scale, but it was extremely bursty.

120
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:57,623
m And when I say like extremely bursty, like the traffic would spike, but it would be very
short-lived.

121
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,160
uh

122
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,701
At Paramount, similar, but not quite to that extent.

123
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:09,202
Like, bursty as in, like, you're gonna see a high rush of traffic when a large event kicks
off.

124
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:16,113
It'll stay relatively high, but it kind of, like, starts to taper off as the events go
down and things like that.

125
00:11:16,113 --> 00:11:23,505
But uh Paramount SRE, like, larger SRE teams, it's usually segmented into...

126
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:24,923
uh

127
00:11:24,923 --> 00:11:25,873
different departments.

128
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:29,275
So you have like an infrastructure focused department.

129
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:34,259
You would have like a DevSecOps because there's a lot of security that goes into SRE.

130
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,041
And you would have like an observability monitoring team.

131
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:43,244
I feel like observability and monitoring is where you hear a lot of like focus on SRE.

132
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:49,531
But it is definitely like segmented into different teams and it is very different at
different places for sure.

133
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:51,779
all your time looking at graphs, that's what I...

134
00:11:52,226 --> 00:12:03,012
When I was more on the infrastructure side of things, but yes, like we work heavily with
uh like the observability team to make sure that the dashboards are in place and they have

135
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:05,965
the data that you need and everything's hooked up properly.

136
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:15,601
That sounds like the go between, like when, get the application metrics into someplace
that a different team owns, and then when that team exposes a problem, you're then have to

137
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:20,829
ferry that back to the application team to tell them about the issue that they caused in
production.

138
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:27,464
Yeah, and that's where like what Forest was saying, it's complicated what?

139
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:32,388
So Will and I had a little joke going on before the stream started.

140
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:41,426
And the joke basically ended where I decided to change his moniker in the stream.

141
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:51,713
That Amy, only you can see, like none of the audience will be able to see this, but yeah.

142
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:53,004
sorry.

143
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:55,142
Oh.

144
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:57,466
You got me.

145
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:59,068
You got me, you got me.

146
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:02,737
You look like a forest, you look like a forest, but Will.

147
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:06,860
joke started is because like Warren is asking me something and I was like, dude, I don't
know.

148
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,613
I just feel like Forrest Gump because I just wander around places in my life and great
shit happens.

149
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:14,096
And then people are like, how'd you do that?

150
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:14,857
And like, I don't know.

151
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:16,126
I was just standing there.

152
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:16,790
you

153
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:20,223
Okay, well well, uh I'm so sorry.

154
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:21,764
I feel terrible now.

155
00:13:21,764 --> 00:13:22,665
You got me good.

156
00:13:22,665 --> 00:13:36,691
Thank you and now I've lost my train of thought a little bit, but What I was about to say
is like there's a fine line because obviously it doesn't make sense for the SRE to be the

157
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:45,935
person that Debugs the code but in a perfect scenario ultimately like the sort of thing
that probably should happen is

158
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:53,991
SRE is usually, sometimes you'll have like a knock team who's kind of like the first line
of defense that does like a smoke test.

159
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:59,113
Like, okay, we got an alert, we got paged, is the application, can I reach it?

160
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:01,824
Like, can I just go to my browser and reach it?

161
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:03,114
Like, is it up?

162
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:08,106
Is it hard down or is latency starting to go down?

163
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:08,947
That sort of thing.

164
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:12,258
And the knock team is usually the first line of defense there.

165
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:20,082
um If the NOC team deems it like, okay, something is awry here, then they'll usually page
SRE team.

166
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:30,051
So SRE team kind of usually you'll have like playbooks in place to do like a sanity check
of like jump on one of the Kubernetes pods, you know, kind of see what's going on.

167
00:14:30,051 --> 00:14:31,221
these pods erroring?

168
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:32,771
ah Something like that.

169
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:45,125
But ultimately what should happen is there should, in my opinion anyways, like a close
relationship with SRE and the development team that it's clear like we have an environment

170
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,106
in this microservices system where we can do a safe rollback.

171
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:49,464
ah

172
00:14:49,464 --> 00:15:02,135
And so what typically would happen, at least in my opinion, my role, I would deem like,
okay, and I have a rough understanding of what the feature is, what's the impact, because

173
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,787
there could be a business impact of rolling back.

174
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:12,654
um Ultimately, want to make, that would, when I say business impact, you have some sort of
like,

175
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:24,014
feature for Black Friday and it's peak traffic and this feature is like driving revenue so
there's like a but it's also like causing issues for customers so you need to kind of make

176
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:34,154
the decision and this is where the stress gets high of like what's the financial trade-off
ultimately here like to this business person like because it honestly like it will bubble

177
00:15:34,154 --> 00:15:37,682
all the way up like through the organization to like

178
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:44,170
the CEO of the company and you need to make the decision of like, what's the lesser of the
financial impacts here?

179
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:53,165
But long-winded answer, like SRE should have confidence from the engineering team that
it's safe to roll back and do like an instant rollback.

180
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:54,906
And it's also then...

181
00:15:55,271 --> 00:16:09,308
helpful as an SRE if like let's say a lot of times you will get paged in the middle of the
night and it's a large organization and sometimes sometimes you have great engineers on

182
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:21,203
your team who you can escalate to and they usually have like a paging rotation also but a
lot of times I'm not gonna lie I was on an SRE team and it's the middle of the night and I

183
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:25,125
page you know I'm looking at this pod that's crashing and

184
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:29,229
And I can see that it's actually an error in the code.

185
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,896
And I page the engineering team and no answer.

186
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:38,765
And I page again and no

187
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:39,810
Hahaha!

188
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:42,696
I have cage again in 20 minutes and crickets.

189
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:53,209
So I've been in a state where like I am just rolling pods all night when I say rolling
pods, like restarting pods over and over and over again until someone wakes up in the

190
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:54,297
morning.

191
00:16:54,309 --> 00:17:02,113
Wait, so when you say NOC, like Network Operation Center, is that mostly to manage the
physical hardware and paying attention?

192
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:13,890
to say I didn't work they were kind of like our first line of defense at some of my jobs
it works super closely with them but yeah those are typically the people that were like

193
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:23,097
the hard like they were used working in the data center and you know the organization
obviously sees like value and kind of transitioning them to different roles and things

194
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:24,316
like that so yeah

195
00:17:24,316 --> 00:17:29,120
So you then have to look at a lot of application specific metrics.

196
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:38,807
So more on the software validation side and then ah be that that ferry that bridge back
from, okay, there's a problem at the hardware level that's getting escalated and having to

197
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,737
find the application team.

198
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:46,507
And of course they have no on-call rotation ever because they're not accountable for
keeping the systems up and running.

199
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:48,330
Their job is to ship code.

200
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:55,350
Yeah, just ship it and hand it over, you know, but that's where, you know, close
relationship also.

201
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,412
And like I'm saying, like, I keep going back to this like production readiness.

202
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:11,737
It should be that before the application team hands over something, like you're saying,
like work with the SRE team in advance to make sure uh that if it's a mission critical

203
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:19,181
service in your microservice architecture, like that the dashboards are in place, you
understand the dependencies.

204
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:30,561
When I say dependencies too, a lot of things that come up in SRE, and that's why it's
just, like I say, a nerd out on distributed system stuff.

205
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:43,981
You can see one application starting to show some latency, but the actual impact is more
so like a service downstream.

206
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:57,695
And there are different ways of like understanding obviously like if this part of the
system is having this percentage of latency, then I need to understand that these

207
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:03,328
downstream services are getting hit by this other service X number of times.

208
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:06,489
It's going to start like having this kind of latency.

209
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:11,852
So you really have to understand like the entire system and understand ah those
dependencies.

210
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:12,672
That's where it helps.

211
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:15,323
Like that's where SRE really comes in because

212
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:27,300
when these application teams are kind of like siloed working on their specific service,
the SRE team is more responsible for understanding like the trace of a request through the

213
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,538
system and understanding those downstream effects.

214
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:30,968
Wow.

215
00:19:30,968 --> 00:19:33,620
mean, you just got into some really deep topics there.

216
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:44,857
Like there's a huge complexity with like queuing theory and window-based, you know,
back-offs there as well as like the system effect, like actual systems thinking of how one

217
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:47,129
thing triggers another thing, which triggers another thing.

218
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:52,942
And I don't remember ever seeing a bootcamp that would have gotten anyone prepared for
handling this.

219
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:53,933
And you got through this.

220
00:19:53,933 --> 00:20:00,679
And now if I understand, you were still like being on the spot to actually make a business
impactful decision.

221
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:17,123
Yes, yes, that's where it gets very stressful ah And that's where I just I feel like in
this kind of role you really need someone who cares ah and Yes, because otherwise the the

222
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:28,152
company's revenue is on the line whether that be Not even like I was saying in the example
of like the Black Friday issue where like you have to make the call of is this shopping

223
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:29,482
cart feature

224
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:43,191
More important than the fact that X number of other users can't do this other thing that
they need to do uh Versus even understanding like the SLAs and do is there like a

225
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:49,503
financial obligation that I need to pay my customers if X number of things start to go
down

226
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:57,328
So did you have like some sort of dashboard that listed out every single feature and like
how much it was supposed to make for the company and like how much the shop, I mean, I

227
00:20:57,328 --> 00:21:02,291
feel like NPM and Paramount are a little bit weird because it's not really like end user
shopping cart scenarios.

228
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:06,434
I mean, I don't really understand Paramount's, know, end user pricing model.

229
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:07,814
I know there's like plus, right?

230
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:15,106
But other than that, so I feel like it's even harder to really understand what the
long-term impact is for each one of those things that's breaking.

231
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:24,314
you know, it's very different obviously at different places like So I keep going back to
the shopping cart example, like I worked at uh Different startups in like the retail

232
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:29,729
industry and although I wasn't on the SRE team there specifically I was more in like a
architectural role.

233
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:34,883
So like kind of tasked with understanding that I'm working with the DevOps team, but

234
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:44,089
Yeah, like in a perfect world you would have dashboards to help you make those decisions,
but you don't have that.

235
00:21:45,112 --> 00:21:53,202
So you just, have to make the best call based on your understanding and, you know,
escalate to the right people if you can.

236
00:21:54,218 --> 00:22:04,071
And that's where I should really get into, know, is maybe like shift the conversation to,
to like strategies besides just like reactive strategies.

237
00:22:04,112 --> 00:22:15,796
Cause we've talked about like a lot of like reactive approaches to things, but part of
what SRE is tasked with is like, how do we make this system more resilient by nature of

238
00:22:15,796 --> 00:22:16,976
things we can do?

239
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:22,150
And I feel like you're in the perfect position to think about and sort of ideate on that.

240
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:27,221
But don't you end up with like a lot of pushback because that's sort of like a shift left
approach in the organization.

241
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:34,930
It's like, know, application product teams, you know, this thing that you're doing that
has like a high likelihood that there's going to be a production impact.

242
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,114
Maybe you should do something different.

243
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:41,085
How do you get that actually across to those teams so they can like start making those
actual changes?

244
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:43,832
Cause it's like a mindset or a culture shift for them.

245
00:22:43,832 --> 00:22:51,306
Well, kind of where I'm going with this is more so on like the redundancy side of things
like SRE team making the decision.

246
00:22:51,306 --> 00:23:02,112
And it's, you have to work with like the engineering management leadership to understand
like, you know, if we're running in like a Kubernetes environment, making that, do we

247
00:23:02,112 --> 00:23:04,853
either, do we do, um, multi cloud?

248
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:10,266
Do we, obviously we do multi region, those sorts of decisions.

249
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:13,268
And then that's where you get into, um,

250
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:21,562
I don't think a lot of people necessarily realize, like I was saying, how valuable, like
content delivery is in this.

251
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:33,087
Um, because just by nature of having as much as you can cashed and distributed outside of
like before the request even gets to whether it's like your physical data center or, or a

252
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:37,539
cloud, um, how can we like offload some of that traffic?

253
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,792
because I feel like a lot of these systems are just the fall over without that.

254
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:43,502
And.

255
00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:52,788
I know we mentioned it like at the beginning of episode and maybe I'll like touch on it
more at the end, but one thing that's been very interesting for me to like sit back and

256
00:23:52,788 --> 00:24:02,742
watch is like Jinae is, I hate saying that word, but it is what it is, it is what it is,
like twofold.

257
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:06,464
First off, like my heart goes out to.

258
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:13,903
I saw their SREs who work in environments where they have like developers that are just
whatever, this whole vibe coding thing.

259
00:24:13,903 --> 00:24:25,684
Like, I don't think people realize how much like these LLMs are hallucinating and
producing like content that is just garbage, absolute garbage.

260
00:24:25,684 --> 00:24:26,944
Yeah.

261
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:31,036
So pour one out for the SRE supporting Vibe coding is what you're saying.

262
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:39,052
I mean, we did have some previous guests on the show who were like swearing to us that
their LLMs didn't ever hallucinate.

263
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:40,056
Yeah.

264
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:49,070
I was like, I think I won't say the LLM because I want to get myself in trouble, I was
like asking, like going back and forth with one of them earlier this week, like writing

265
00:24:49,070 --> 00:25:04,467
stuff and I asked it to revise it and it started like putting all these like statistics in
and I was like, I was using a product that allowed me to uh incorporate a lot of like

266
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:06,988
basically like a rag gooey.

267
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:09,860
So I could incorporate like a bunch of external sources.

268
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,773
And I was like, there's no way those statistics are in those sources.

269
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,445
Because I know the data that I added.

270
00:25:17,445 --> 00:25:20,567
And I asked it, where did you get these statistics?

271
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:21,947
And it's like, you're right, I made them up.

272
00:25:21,947 --> 00:25:23,018
I'm sorry.

273
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:33,951
I mean, at least you got a conclusive answer there because we're seeing this a lot more
with uh SEO to articles today where not only are they being generated by LLMs, but the

274
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:38,763
links that they go to do not back up whatever is in the article.

275
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:41,984
like, so even if a human is writing it, it's just some fluff piece.

276
00:25:41,984 --> 00:25:46,446
And if you go there, it's like, 60 % of attacks are from this particular source.

277
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:49,457
Like email is the source of all attacks and security isn't.

278
00:25:49,457 --> 00:25:51,410
And you go and you click on the link and it's just some.

279
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:57,593
completely made up garbage that's also not researched by some other company that had
nothing to do with the topic whatsoever.

280
00:25:57,593 --> 00:26:06,378
So can you blame the probabilistic, you know, statistical engine that's just predicting
the next word that is also going to pull out links that have nothing to do with the topic

281
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:07,286
whatsoever?

282
00:26:07,286 --> 00:26:13,469
Yes, yeah, you can't blame it, but it's like it's on us to, you know, it.

283
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:18,819
But what I wanted to touch on that very briefly was just basically like I read something
this morning.

284
00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:31,641
like the percentage, like there's a direct correlation between these companies that are
allowing like more AI assistive, like developer stuff em and outages.

285
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:42,166
So I'd have to like, I think I screenshotted it on LinkedIn, but there was like, it was a
lot and it was just in the back of my mind.

286
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,346
So there's that side of things.

287
00:26:43,346 --> 00:26:49,599
And then there's also just like these like, you know, open AI and all these companies like
pushing out.

288
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,531
a race to get stuff out to production faster.

289
00:26:52,531 --> 00:27:02,979
there's like, I think last year, just the number of outages, like every time I would go to
Chad GPT, I think for like almost like a week, was like half the time I was down.

290
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:04,288
So.

291
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:06,209
I think the jury is really out on the numbers.

292
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:11,151
I think we've concluded two things and whether or not people are willing to listen to
those is a separate topic.

293
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:14,993
You are trading quality or speed.

294
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,014
That is the trade off.

295
00:27:17,014 --> 00:27:24,437
so, I think there are a bunch of good articles recently by people who work at some of
these.

296
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:26,888
You say you don't like the word gen AI.

297
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:28,359
I really hate the word agentic.

298
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:30,728
ah That's mine.

299
00:27:30,728 --> 00:27:31,411
ah

300
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:37,683
companies that they themselves are not using their own LLM to produce the code, right?

301
00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:46,036
And so, you know, I see these CEOs say, yeah, know, Stan, I'm like, our company, like 25 %
of all the source code we write is by, you know, some sort of LLM.

302
00:27:46,036 --> 00:27:49,327
And I'm like, ah what are you going to do about that risk?

303
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:52,568
You know, you're going to decrease that in the future.

304
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:57,039
Yeah, and I mean, I should say, like, I'm not opposed to these tools, but they need to be
used responsibly.

305
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,091
And for better or worse, like, humans, like, it's our nature.

306
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:10,013
Like, that's what, like, the famous, like, programming quote, like, we're lazy, like, a
lazy person makes a good programmer, because they want to automate things.

307
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:18,256
So, like, there's a lot of value in these tools, but you hands down need to use them
responsibly and be able to...

308
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,103
use them with actual knowledge behind it.

309
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:30,147
I mentor a lot of developers and they're wanting to get stuff done.

310
00:28:30,147 --> 00:28:34,349
I'll see this code that they wrote and I'm like, I know where you got that from.

311
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:35,869
That's not right.

312
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:46,475
I don't know why it's telling you to install Python packages in your code application, but
this is not right.

313
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,747
app anyways.

314
00:28:50,306 --> 00:28:55,733
But on a side note, I'm really admired that you got those Python packages to work inside
of Node.js.

315
00:28:57,224 --> 00:29:02,141
It just comes with a foreign function interface and you just shell out to that, no big
deal.

316
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:04,475
And your application, it's just multiple programming language.

317
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:05,385
What's the big deal?

318
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:08,065
It's all assembly under the hood.

319
00:29:08,065 --> 00:29:10,956
Exactly, it's all ones and zeros, what does it matter?

320
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:11,752
Right?

321
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:12,594
For now.

322
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,256
You can.

323
00:29:14,256 --> 00:29:15,994
oh

324
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:28,842
So I want to come back to um talking about playbooks because you mentioned those and I got
excited, but I think like an important m thing to hang the playbook conversation on is

325
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:42,075
that talking about being an SRE at scale because like being an SRE at a small company
versus being an SRE at an enterprise, I think are quite possibly two completely different

326
00:29:42,075 --> 00:29:43,715
career fields.

327
00:29:44,056 --> 00:29:45,602
And so

328
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:52,363
How did you address the scale of applications you were dealing with?

329
00:29:54,097 --> 00:29:55,488
that's a good question, too.

330
00:29:55,488 --> 00:30:09,101
I think it really, so like talking about this like microservice system where a lot of
people usually are at right now, typically everything is like a trade-off and that's like

331
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,142
a hand-wavy answer, but it's true.

332
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:23,756
And so when we go back to the production readiness stuff, I think it's helpful to
understand uh a process of rating these microservices.

333
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:25,947
Is this tier one, tier two, tier three?

334
00:30:25,947 --> 00:30:29,988
An auth system is probably going to be a tier one system.

335
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:34,362
Whereas if you have a...

336
00:30:35,062 --> 00:30:45,671
recommendations engine that's running things in the background that's more of like a tier
three system because critical functionality still works.

337
00:30:45,752 --> 00:30:49,295
Checkout is going to be obviously a tier one system, something like that.

338
00:30:49,295 --> 00:30:53,128
uh But there's a lot of things to consider.

339
00:30:53,128 --> 00:31:00,324
I feel like especially like for people that are getting into this kind of role, it's
important to understand.

340
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:14,067
like the traffic patterns, like if you're working in like a small startup, you're
accountable to your customers, like maybe just during like business hours, like a banking

341
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:22,633
application or something like that is not gonna be as critical as an application that's
used internationally, things like that.

342
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:28,993
Those are like, does that kind of answer your question, like things to consider?

343
00:31:28,993 --> 00:31:30,733
Yeah, for sure.

344
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:42,153
And then tying that back to playbooks, like there's a certain level of scale where you
just can't be familiar with all of these systems and you have to rely on playbooks.

345
00:31:42,153 --> 00:31:50,493
So what are some of the strategies that you've seen to making sure that you have an
accurate up-to-date playbook when you need it?

346
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,574
Up to date is key.

347
00:31:53,894 --> 00:31:55,677
Everything is legacy as soon as you write it.

348
00:31:55,677 --> 00:31:58,681
Like, as soon as you write something down, it is out of date.

349
00:31:58,681 --> 00:32:01,832
That code is already wrong as soon as it's released.

350
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:10,087
That yeah, so that's I'm gonna go back to like building out an SRE team is

351
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:17,144
You need technical skills, obviously, but you really need people who take ownership and
care.

352
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:26,193
ah Like we're talking about the playbooks, like I've definitely been at companies where I
will get brand new.

353
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:27,054
I'll get paid.

354
00:32:27,054 --> 00:32:34,000
I go to the playbook and I see that like the playbooks and get ah it hasn't been updated
in five years.

355
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,221
Hahaha.

356
00:32:35,885 --> 00:32:39,109
And I'm like, you know, shoot crap.

357
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:40,165
Like, what do I do?

358
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:41,850
Like I'm getting paged.

359
00:32:42,492 --> 00:32:47,296
Usually like when you're paged, it will point you to the playbook and it's not there.

360
00:32:47,296 --> 00:32:54,222
So, m you know, the best way that I've seen people tackle this is like ownership.

361
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,303
um Someone needs to own these playbooks.

362
00:32:56,303 --> 00:33:02,869
um Somebody, if a system is like a tier one or a tier two system, like

363
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:08,929
this is part of this production readiness checklist before SRE is okay with deploying
this.

364
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:23,508
uh And a lot of times the SRE team is, not really the gatekeeper because a lot of these
companies, the developers have the ability to ship themselves, but there are obviously

365
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:26,259
consequences if they ship something and it crashes.

366
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:28,134
Hahaha.

367
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:41,384
doesn't completely come that that is like a shared ownership but having there needs to be
ownership of these playbooks and that's usually done by the sre team typically

368
00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:55,342
you will get the leadership knows when something is very critical and good leadership will
make sure that these teams are communicating on like a regular cadence.

369
00:33:55,342 --> 00:34:04,385
I'm big on like these regular cadences, not necessarily because meetings kind of suck, but
they are important for communication.

370
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:10,933
that you put the responsibility of the playbooks on the SRE team.

371
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:21,177
It was actually a debate that ah my CEO and myself have been talking about a bunch where
if it's an artifact that gets thrown over the wall, it's not going, like you can't, it

372
00:34:21,177 --> 00:34:22,788
doesn't contain knowledge in a way.

373
00:34:22,788 --> 00:34:25,409
It contains, they're usually actionable things.

374
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:33,532
And so since the knowledge isn't there, you won't know how to adapt to a playbook when you
get to a new scenario that's not.

375
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:36,101
encountered before, right?

376
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:41,621
And most of the problems that we find in systems that we automate are only problems that
we haven't seen before.

377
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:54,763
And I will say too, so when I say like having accountability and ownership, that's where
for better or worse, everybody hates on-call schedules, but those on-call schedules do

378
00:34:54,763 --> 00:35:05,672
serve as kind of like a back propagation of like if somebody is on, if you're on an
on-call rotation and you're getting paid frequently, like you have a vested interest in

379
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:11,777
stopping that because if it gets out of hand, it's just a huge snowball of

380
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:18,323
You know, obviously like you, you are starting to like your sleep is interrupted.

381
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:23,596
So, and for better or worse, like people will be like, you know, you had a rough night,
take it easy during the day.

382
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:24,026
Yeah, right.

383
00:35:24,026 --> 00:35:25,326
That's not happening.

384
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:31,900
You're still getting up and doing your usual hours, but you're just like, I'm dead.

385
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,702
So there's a vested interest in, in like sharing that ownership of the on-call rotation.

386
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:43,415
And if you're getting paged constantly, like you're going to want to make sure that your
teammates have the playbooks in place and your

387
00:35:43,415 --> 00:35:49,615
Like I just had a huge outage and these are the steps that I took to remediate this.

388
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:50,935
These are the things that were helpful.

389
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:59,555
So after my on-call rotation, I'm going to go in and update the playbook and make sure
that the steps that I took are there so that maybe there's like more junior members on the

390
00:35:59,555 --> 00:35:59,695
team.

391
00:35:59,695 --> 00:36:01,335
They also know and things like that.

392
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:06,615
Because usually too, in like these kinds of environments, like you'll have like multiple
tiers there.

393
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:12,595
So there's a knock, but then even within SRE, like I think it's helpful to have like
multiple tiers of SRE support.

394
00:36:12,595 --> 00:36:13,555
So you have like

395
00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:24,309
more senior level SREs and then more junior level SREs and like maybe maybe during the day
you would page more junior SRE or something like that whereas a senior is around to step

396
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:27,350
in right away but you want to have stuff in place for

397
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:35,692
What I'm hearing is you're a huge proponent of these incident management tools that are
generating playbooks dynamically on the fly using some sort of LLM.

398
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:37,602
eh

399
00:36:37,602 --> 00:36:41,799
As long as someone's reviewing them, that's fine by me.

400
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:48,876
like, yeah, these LLMs are helpful, but they are not the end all, like, it's not the end
of the road.

401
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:52,082
You just gave me my next startup idea, Warren.

402
00:36:52,931 --> 00:37:02,407
I mean, have to compete with some of our past guests, I think, uh are already promising uh
dynamic run books based on, I mean, there is a thing that I think Sentry does, and I think

403
00:37:02,407 --> 00:37:10,633
there's a couple other tools now that they have your source code, uh or at least this, and
then they have the stack trace from the error and the actual error message, and they use

404
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:17,488
that to automatically propose a pull request into your Git repository that supposedly
fixes the problem so that someone can review and approve it.

405
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:21,930
And you gotta know that at 3 a.m., you are just gonna click approve.

406
00:37:24,272 --> 00:37:26,215
Yeah, yeah, that's dangerous.

407
00:37:26,215 --> 00:37:34,528
Yeah, all those tools, like I said, I think they're helpful, but they need to be used
responsibly and with somebody who is actually like a human being with background that

408
00:37:34,528 --> 00:37:35,713
says, yeah, you're me.

409
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:41,137
Yeah, I think we're still discovering like what the rules of responsibility are.

410
00:37:41,137 --> 00:37:52,778
Like, I feel like we're learning quickly, but we're still learning, you know, some of
those being like, you have to give the, you have to give it very discrete tasks.

411
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:59,690
You know, ask it to do one thing so that the result that comes back to you is something
you can actually parse in your head.

412
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:06,312
you know, don't give it something that you don't know how to do because then you have no
way to check its work.

413
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:14,365
another one that I use that I really like is treat it like your own personal intern or
junior developer.

414
00:38:14,365 --> 00:38:18,556
You know, you wouldn't like hire an intern and then say,

415
00:38:19,018 --> 00:38:24,344
you know, hey, go architect this uh four tiered microservice for us.

416
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,616
It'll be due by Friday.

417
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:28,990
uh

418
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,811
something there, Will.

419
00:38:29,811 --> 00:38:38,987
I will say that maybe it's just forcing us to finally think about concretely how humans
should actually work together effectively.

420
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,609
I, you know, in the last, you know, what is the year 2025?

421
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:44,551
We haven't figured out how to do that correctly.

422
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:48,854
And now we're throwing in a tool into the mix, which actually requires us to do that work.

423
00:38:48,854 --> 00:38:49,510
I...

424
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:58,362
I'm gonna guess it's gonna be like another 200 years before we've got we've got we've got
that, you know, actually figured out how to optimally communicate one human being to

425
00:38:58,362 --> 00:38:58,613
another.

426
00:38:58,613 --> 00:38:59,725
She says

427
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:10,291
have a teenager and like, I would just like to point out that we have been peopling for
millions of years and we still do not have a good way to make the teenagers not really,

428
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:11,443
really dumb, okay?

429
00:39:11,443 --> 00:39:13,616
Like, just, it's never gonna happen.

430
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,167
It's never gonna happen.

431
00:39:15,442 --> 00:39:17,162
Millions is a bit long.

432
00:39:17,162 --> 00:39:24,382
I'll give you like 400,000 or so, I do definitely accept that argument.

433
00:39:25,482 --> 00:39:27,862
But you know, acceleration of evolution.

434
00:39:27,862 --> 00:39:30,058
So maybe we'll get there faster this time.

435
00:39:30,154 --> 00:39:32,963
Moore's law for humans, that's a thing, right?

436
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,355
Yeah.

437
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:37,436
I really appreciate Moore's law.

438
00:39:37,436 --> 00:39:42,275
ah What I don't appreciate is people saying that Moore's law applies to things that it
doesn't apply to.

439
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:54,716
I I totally agree that the principle by, uh what is it, correlation doesn't necessarily
imply uh causation, although you look at lots of things and they do double at some rate

440
00:39:54,716 --> 00:39:55,536
that's.

441
00:39:55,544 --> 00:39:57,805
But people get Moore's law wrong a lot.

442
00:39:57,805 --> 00:39:59,155
They apply to things that don't make sense.

443
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:04,587
It is literally just the size of the transistors will reduce by half every 18 months.

444
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:04,947
That's it.

445
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:05,977
That's the whole law.

446
00:40:05,977 --> 00:40:08,588
It doesn't apply statistically to anything else.

447
00:40:08,588 --> 00:40:15,279
Now, we do see doubling and size reduction and other things definitely like dies on a chip
and et cetera.

448
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,630
But there's an interesting thing.

449
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:22,201
Does it apply to these new plastic chips that it was China producing now that don't use
silicon?

450
00:40:22,282 --> 00:40:23,962
I don't remember the material.

451
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:27,339
and that are supposedly like half or a tenth of the size.

452
00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:29,622
know, just Moore's law apply there too.

453
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:30,653
I have no idea.

454
00:40:30,653 --> 00:40:32,235
I was just trying to make a joke.

455
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:34,983
for us.

456
00:40:38,008 --> 00:40:49,494
to backtrack just like a little bit uh and point out Amy that I really like your kind of
go-gettiveness I guess with understanding actually what the business needs because I work

457
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:58,259
with a lot of people and especially students and they just have no idea like no idea like
what it is like what is supposed to be the end result of this kind of like process that

458
00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:06,404
they're doing and I think it's very important I mean it's important from like work but I
think it's also very important from a career perspective as well like would you like to

459
00:41:06,404 --> 00:41:07,246
keep your job?

460
00:41:07,246 --> 00:41:12,728
maybe get new jobs, like, you should understand what's going on, at least a little bit.

461
00:41:12,815 --> 00:41:15,136
Yeah, like I said, I don't know.

462
00:41:15,136 --> 00:41:22,150
just like still to this day, feel very fortunate to like be able to do something that I
pretty much enjoy every single day.

463
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:35,826
And I just, don't know, maybe I was just like too harsh growing up or something, but I'm
just like, I feel like if I'm getting a salary, then I should be.

464
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:44,854
There is value in pushing back sometimes when she's senior enough to have a level of
expertise in a professional and respectful way.

465
00:41:45,015 --> 00:41:58,821
But yes, at the end of the day, our job, whether we like it or not, is to make this
company profitable, whether that be features, uh making sure that users have uh confidence

466
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:01,303
in the service via SRE, stuff like that.

467
00:42:01,303 --> 00:42:05,906
they're gonna say despite leadership's uh strategy to the contrary.

468
00:42:05,906 --> 00:42:20,225
uh I am sort of curious if you have any personal strategies for gleaning better insight
into how the business should work or how a feature that is say technical transforms into

469
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:21,575
value for the business.

470
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:27,359
Are you working with product managers or with someone on the marketing and sales team?

471
00:42:28,237 --> 00:42:32,091
grabbing information from the internet, like how are you actually figuring this out?

472
00:42:32,731 --> 00:42:35,593
Like what is and isn't valuable for the business?

473
00:42:37,194 --> 00:42:44,039
I guess for me personally, over my career, it probably depends on the domain I'm working
in.

474
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:49,022
So I've worked in domains of the construction industry.

475
00:42:49,022 --> 00:42:53,445
I don't have expertise in what these people want.

476
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:56,611
Obviously, I...

477
00:42:56,611 --> 00:43:03,606
Like my personality, I want to understand the domain that I'm working in so that I can try
to better understand these types of things.

478
00:43:03,606 --> 00:43:07,639
But in that sort of scenario, like I am going to lean more like on the product people.

479
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:19,086
Now, if it's like a dev focused company, ah you know, my own thoughts, obviously, like
doing this a while, like having friends that I work with and like hearing their stories.

480
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:20,427
ah

481
00:43:20,547 --> 00:43:23,739
that goes into like what is and isn't valuable.

482
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:30,627
Like I'm trying to think of like different scenarios like that I've been in.

483
00:43:30,627 --> 00:43:40,116
uh There was definitely one uh later on in my career where there was like, this is like an
SRE type thing.

484
00:43:40,116 --> 00:43:46,673
So like the security team was extremely focused on like getting this tool out.

485
00:43:46,673 --> 00:43:52,448
because they were getting paged based on things that were happening.

486
00:43:52,448 --> 00:44:05,718
uh But the tool that they had vetted, while it seemed good, it was a very rushed job to
get it out in time.

487
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:14,185
And so on my side of things, there was a lot of code that needed to be deployed to get
form the infrastructure.

488
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,206
I'm being a little vague.

489
00:44:15,206 --> 00:44:16,747
uh

490
00:44:17,995 --> 00:44:19,407
fair, that's fair.

491
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:23,415
can clarify I will but at the end of the sorry you are

492
00:44:23,415 --> 00:44:30,878
No, but it works because the more vague you are, the more trauma that listeners will have
because it will relate to their situation.

493
00:44:30,878 --> 00:44:34,581
Like I have like three different traumas right now, just based off of what you said.

494
00:44:34,581 --> 00:44:42,105
know, security teams pushing stuff out, you know, not knowing what to do, you know, not
well vetted software that now everyone is dependent on.

495
00:44:42,105 --> 00:44:45,632
you know, not a short number of times.

496
00:44:45,632 --> 00:44:55,819
yeah, so like, and I have like, in this particular scenario, like a really close
relationship, like really got long well with the team that wanted to push this out.

497
00:44:55,941 --> 00:45:00,564
In the SRE side of things, keep saying you have to understand the tier one, tier two, tier
three.

498
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,535
And this was getting deployed to tier one.

499
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:05,608
So this is getting deployed at the edge.

500
00:45:05,608 --> 00:45:13,043
So if this goes wrong, the request doesn't go through.

501
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,054
It's not even a latency issue.

502
00:45:15,054 --> 00:45:15,794
It's

503
00:45:16,785 --> 00:45:21,758
Yeah, it's, I don't know, I see Lauren like shaking his head, so I'm.

504
00:45:21,758 --> 00:45:23,098
I was gonna say past trauma.

505
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:33,983
actually, Will and I did an episode last year about how to handle scaling around the
holidays uh because it's a time, especially for companies that do e-commerce, et cetera,

506
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:37,504
anything with orders, there is a huge spike in how to be prepared for that.

507
00:45:37,504 --> 00:45:42,716
And it's sort of interesting that if you break down the system thinking model, you brought
it up.

508
00:45:42,716 --> 00:45:49,426
There is this perverse incentive where if you have a deadline that you are more likely to
rush to meet that deadline.

509
00:45:49,426 --> 00:45:53,322
which means that you cut more corners, which means the thing is more risky.

510
00:45:53,322 --> 00:46:02,949
And so if you create a deadline or a code freeze to prevent risky code from getting into
production, you are actually encouraging the exact thing that you are trying to prevent.

511
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:11,607
So, and like also on that end, and this is where like it, I guess it does, like you start
to like traumatic events and you.

512
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:13,880
That is usually the case.

513
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:24,953
I've also seen the case of we do a code freeze and a system doesn't get touched for six
months, maybe even a year.

514
00:46:25,773 --> 00:46:37,717
And then you decide that you do want to deploy like a new feature and boom, it's down and
hard down because nobody has touched it in a year.

515
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:51,402
And so like this certain situation that I ran into once we had like a re-indexing job and
there was so much data to re-index that what that the machines that it had been running on

516
00:46:51,402 --> 00:46:53,913
could no longer support the re-index process.

517
00:46:53,913 --> 00:46:58,454
So we're like screwed at this point.

518
00:46:58,454 --> 00:47:02,576
So yes, so you have to wait.

519
00:47:02,576 --> 00:47:08,409
And there's trade-offs in all regards and as SRE like it's just

520
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:17,172
really your job to try to understand like not even like what's the perfect scenario but
like what's the the least of like the evils here.

521
00:47:17,172 --> 00:47:21,104
AWS actually is a really interesting guide for resilience engineering.

522
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:31,490
And one of the things that they talk a lot about is what happens when there is like one or
two points of failure, what actual new systems start coming into play, what is the request

523
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:34,382
volume start to look like versus the nominal state?

524
00:47:34,382 --> 00:47:37,214
uh And you mentioned caches at the edge.

525
00:47:37,214 --> 00:47:40,576
And I think one of the most common scenarios is why do you add a cache?

526
00:47:40,576 --> 00:47:44,948
Well, because you're trying to reduce the load on your system, which means that you...

527
00:47:45,108 --> 00:47:48,191
the ability to create higher load on your system to hit the cache.

528
00:47:48,191 --> 00:47:57,638
And as soon as the cache drops or gets busted because you're using something like Val-key,
because no one's using Redis anymore, of course, uh which isn't designed to be persistent,

529
00:47:57,638 --> 00:48:02,913
it's going to drop at some point, which means you're going to get a lot of load to your
system without going through the cache.

530
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:04,686
And it's going to cause a hard failure at that point.

531
00:48:04,686 --> 00:48:06,025
And how are you going to recover?

532
00:48:06,025 --> 00:48:13,952
And so it sounds great to add a cache in, but then you're to have to deal with this quite
critical scenario where you are just, instead of being able to handle any number of

533
00:48:13,952 --> 00:48:14,758
requests,

534
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,534
you're going to be able to handle nothing.

535
00:48:16,534 --> 00:48:20,506
Yeah, back to like what you're saying, the distributed system stuff.

536
00:48:20,907 --> 00:48:29,158
In my mind, you brought up like single point of failure and it's just like the nature of
how things work.

537
00:48:29,158 --> 00:48:31,263
Like you're always going to have a single point of failure.

538
00:48:31,263 --> 00:48:34,485
And it's not so much like, how do we get rid of the single point of failure?

539
00:48:34,485 --> 00:48:39,978
Cause I don't even think that's possible ah because you're gonna have like traffic
management at some point.

540
00:48:39,978 --> 00:48:41,599
Like what if the traffic management fails?

541
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,178
ah

542
00:48:43,178 --> 00:48:53,898
It's more so in my mind, like what is, what system seems to be the most resilient and
that's where we want to place the single point of failure.

543
00:48:53,898 --> 00:49:04,433
So like, usually it is like the distribution, like if you have like a cash distribution,
that is usually the, in my opinion, like your wisest single point of failure, but issues.

544
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:05,975
an interesting way of phrasing it.

545
00:49:05,975 --> 00:49:07,988
I haven't heard that perspective before.

546
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:11,476
What's your on-call rotation look like?

547
00:49:13,531 --> 00:49:17,112
So it's super different based on the company.

548
00:49:17,172 --> 00:49:27,412
I am a big fan of companies who are hopefully you work at a company that's large enough
that they have engineers across the globe.

549
00:49:27,412 --> 00:49:37,172
And so your on-call rotation can fall within the hours that allow you to work optimally
and not be up all night.

550
00:49:38,736 --> 00:49:45,621
But like I said, I also firmly believe like everybody should share in the on-call rotation
because it shares ownership.

551
00:49:45,621 --> 00:49:50,063
And if things start to go awry, then you have a vested interest in making things better.

552
00:49:50,424 --> 00:49:53,346
But the on-call rotation, like it is what it is.

553
00:49:53,346 --> 00:50:04,243
And, you know, it can be a little rough at the beginning, but it's a great way to learn,
honestly, like just dive in because there's nobody knows everything in the system.

554
00:50:04,243 --> 00:50:07,793
Like you're going to hit something that probably somebody hasn't hit before.

555
00:50:07,793 --> 00:50:13,832
When you say everyone, what's the size of the org that you're thinking about there?

556
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:20,474
You know, I've been in teams where like my on-call rotation honestly was like every other
week Which is a little rough.

557
00:50:20,474 --> 00:50:31,508
I've been on teams where it's I want to say like maybe once a month or something like that
I feel like that's pretty reasonable I think it's helpful to have like I said like the

558
00:50:31,508 --> 00:50:34,779
tiers of support also to like

559
00:50:36,496 --> 00:50:47,314
Hopefully it doesn't get to this point, but it's definitely a real thing I've seen with
myself and others where you're on an issue for 24, 40 hours straight and you need to hand

560
00:50:47,314 --> 00:50:51,286
that off because after a certain amount of time, you're you're brain dead.

561
00:50:51,286 --> 00:50:55,949
ah Or you need to bathe.

562
00:50:57,791 --> 00:51:05,146
I mean, I guess if I think of military or something, you can go a long time without
bathing, so maybe that's not the best example, but.

563
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:08,543
Like more, need sleep to.

564
00:51:10,646 --> 00:51:15,230
Yeah, like you, you need sleep to be able to like debug things.

565
00:51:15,527 --> 00:51:23,946
but there should usually, I feel like in a proper on call rotation, like a handoff phase,
if it's been like more than 24 hours, something like that.

566
00:51:23,946 --> 00:51:32,663
Yeah, I will I think follow the sun implies that you like you hand it off to someone who's
still awake at that time and not you just stay awake until the sun comes up.

567
00:51:32,663 --> 00:51:38,964
That, that, that in my experience, that typically works the best.

568
00:51:38,964 --> 00:51:49,537
So this may be a little bit of a tangent, since you're from the JavaScript Jabber podcast,
I have to ask you preference, Node.js, Denno, or Bun.

569
00:51:49,825 --> 00:51:53,067
I'm old and boring so I like nodes still.

570
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:59,210
I've talked to like the Dino team and like I don't have anything against that.

571
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:04,223
just I'm old and boring and yeah.

572
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,099
Hahaha!

573
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:07,032
Perl, so like, I agree.

574
00:52:07,034 --> 00:52:11,279
I think it's just fitting that she said, like Pearl and the rest of the audio cut out
after that.

575
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:12,767
m

576
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:18,452
part is like it's still recording for her, so we'll find out when the episode released
what she actually said.

577
00:52:19,685 --> 00:52:20,978
I know, I just froze.

578
00:52:20,978 --> 00:52:22,511
I don't know.

579
00:52:22,553 --> 00:52:25,951
It's only for this podcast, you guys, that I have so many technical problems.

580
00:52:25,951 --> 00:52:27,956
Like, I'm fine in all of my other meetings.

581
00:52:27,956 --> 00:52:29,288
It's just this.

582
00:52:29,424 --> 00:52:33,078
Your neighbor is probably doing something right now if you live.

583
00:52:33,078 --> 00:52:34,102
you, Jillian.

584
00:52:34,102 --> 00:52:34,934
That's good.

585
00:52:34,934 --> 00:52:36,239
I have no comment.

586
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,334
That's probably for the best.

587
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:40,535
quite possibly.

588
00:52:40,578 --> 00:52:45,870
How do you deal with the complexity of having to share so much knowledge with so many
people?

589
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:54,464
So the more people that are working in a solution and an or area and a team and an org
means there's more things that are going to be created, which means there's more things

590
00:52:54,464 --> 00:53:01,107
everyone will have to be aware of to potentially deal with when an on-call incident comes
up.

591
00:53:01,107 --> 00:53:08,660
Is there a good metric or litmus test to figure out what the maximum amount of stuff is
that a team can actually manage?

592
00:53:08,671 --> 00:53:19,676
You know, honestly, that is a very good question and I feel like I don't have a good
answer, but now that's something I want to go see if I can dig into more.

593
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:25,159
But I also say like how we have like these different like tiers of support.

594
00:53:26,743 --> 00:53:31,927
It's hard if you get into a more senior role because stuff is going to bubble up to you.

595
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:35,690
But it's usually helpful in a large team.

596
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:41,234
There's usually even SLAs to the developer team, so even a lower environment.

597
00:53:41,987 --> 00:53:48,627
is going to be held accountable to the business to keep a lower environment up in a
certain amount of time.

598
00:53:50,167 --> 00:54:00,207
Sort of related to your question, having those types of people work in those environments,
and that helps distribute knowledge of how these different systems work without being

599
00:54:00,207 --> 00:54:03,007
tasked with the actual production environment.

600
00:54:03,247 --> 00:54:11,966
And then if they do well in those lower environments, then they can kind of move on to a
production environment, and that helps spread the knowledge.

601
00:54:11,966 --> 00:54:23,266
Right, that's, I mean, I think there's a corollary here where I often have to advise some
companies on which is we have like five different mobile apps, because there's many

602
00:54:23,266 --> 00:54:24,386
different providers out there.

603
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:32,686
And then there's a website and also web native version for your mobile app that isn't like
an app version, but is responsive.

604
00:54:32,966 --> 00:54:35,186
And then there's backend that goes within the infrastructure.

605
00:54:35,186 --> 00:54:36,866
Is that all one team?

606
00:54:36,866 --> 00:54:39,406
So everyone is cross-functional and understand what's going on?

607
00:54:39,406 --> 00:54:41,074
Or do you have like 10 teams?

608
00:54:41,074 --> 00:54:43,237
that each have the exact same functionality.

609
00:54:43,237 --> 00:54:47,362
I feel like the answer keeps on being, well, they're both wrong.

610
00:54:47,362 --> 00:54:49,284
And there's no good solution there.

611
00:54:49,284 --> 00:54:51,526
And you just got to have to deal with the consequences.

612
00:54:51,626 --> 00:54:56,188
It's also, mean, this is why I did startups for a long time.

613
00:54:56,388 --> 00:55:09,304
But as I've gotten like further into my career, I feel like it's hard to make an impact
unless you've been at the company for really, for a good amount of time, because the

614
00:55:09,304 --> 00:55:14,536
larger the code base and like the domain, then you really do need that time to understand
it.

615
00:55:14,536 --> 00:55:18,496
eh Whereas like a startup is usually like a smaller app.

616
00:55:18,496 --> 00:55:27,770
and you can understand it more, like a lot of these like larger companies, they have like
these huge systems and it takes time to understand it.

617
00:55:28,479 --> 00:55:30,220
That's a really interesting challenge then.

618
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:35,373
ah We see in the tech industry the average tenure for engineers reducing over time.

619
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:45,058
Does that mean that we're actually more and more incapable of building larger systems
because people aren't staying at the company to be able to diagnose and build more

620
00:55:45,058 --> 00:55:46,028
resilient systems?

621
00:55:46,028 --> 00:55:50,511
Are we still attempting to do that in the systems we're building just aren't resilient
anymore?

622
00:55:50,511 --> 00:55:57,244
Or is this just like you see whatever problems are close to you and larger companies with
bigger solutions are

623
00:55:57,244 --> 00:56:05,928
doing a good job at retaining uh experienced staff that have experience in their own
solution in order to help solve those challenges.

624
00:56:05,928 --> 00:56:10,552
It's very tricky because there's a trade-off both ways.

625
00:56:10,552 --> 00:56:20,601
When you stay at a company long enough, yes, you might have some siloed information and
start to not know how other people are solving problems.

626
00:56:20,601 --> 00:56:26,296
And then that can produce some blind spots in your knowledge.

627
00:56:26,296 --> 00:56:33,181
But at the same time, if you don't stay at a place long enough, ah it can be hard to see.

628
00:56:34,702 --> 00:56:47,242
like how this huge system interacts and be able to really solve like these harder problems
because it takes a while to like get the whole domain the whole system in your head.

629
00:56:47,242 --> 00:56:53,798
It's it is it there's definitely like oh like a vested interest I feel like in these
companies and like retaining people.

630
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:54,758
Oh yeah, for sure.

631
00:56:54,758 --> 00:56:57,580
mean, there's the benefits to them and not to the individual.

632
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:05,903
And a lot of times, I mean, I guess, you know, maybe a different way of phrasing this is
if we look at Dunbar's number and org is going to be at max like 150 people, how many

633
00:57:05,903 --> 00:57:10,645
years of experience working in that company do we project?

634
00:57:10,645 --> 00:57:20,350
Someone would, a new hire would have to work before they are at the point where they're
delivering or understanding the system sufficiently that 150 person org has created.

635
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,289
Any thoughts on that?

636
00:57:21,289 --> 00:57:30,409
That's an interesting question too, like how it kind of like scales based on the size and
the system and how long you'd have to be there, but...

637
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:35,952
Man, I...

638
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:43,915
yeah, once I'm there, you know, six months, I feel like I'm now somewhat accountable for
every system or a year or two years or something like that.

639
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:57,545
Probably, this doesn't answer your question, unfortunately, but I would say, like, one of
the things that could be helpful is, like, if you start to, like, segment your career

640
00:57:57,545 --> 00:58:04,232
working in a similar domain, so some of that knowledge is transferable, like, whether...

641
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:14,429
you're talking about like the hyperscaler that you're working on or if you're more focused
on like CDN distribution, like maybe that's valuable to other companies.

642
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:24,249
Whereas like if it's a, you know, if it's a pay walled type of application, then maybe
your CDN experience is not as beneficial there.

643
00:58:24,394 --> 00:58:30,382
I think also when you say 150 person or you refer into like the entire company or just
engineering.

644
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:38,124
I mean, even a subset of engineering potentially, like I just like a dumb bars number,
like your teams are going to be like two pizza teams for instance, that are

645
00:58:38,124 --> 00:58:44,197
cross-functional, but then there are different types of teams and different features
within the product or product suite that you're delivering.

646
00:58:44,197 --> 00:58:47,399
And that can only get up to 150 above that.

647
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:52,972
You need to create a second org and have them work on a completely different feature set
with a completely different focus.

648
00:58:52,972 --> 00:58:59,588
You you think of like how in a hyperscaler, I'm going to use Google workspace as an
example, like email or Gmail and drive, right?

649
00:58:59,588 --> 00:59:09,383
I could imagine those being separate completely separate orgs for instance, but I would
not expect one org structure where it's fundamentally accountable for every single product

650
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:10,374
in Google workspace.

651
00:59:10,374 --> 00:59:12,065
There's just too much stuff there.

652
00:59:12,065 --> 00:59:20,770
So that's the part for me that makes the most sense that you can't have more than 150
people working on the same product because there's only so much functional work there and

653
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:23,531
at a larger size you have a communication breakdown.

654
00:59:23,531 --> 00:59:25,402
You can't pass the information effectively.

655
00:59:25,402 --> 00:59:29,231
So that's just sort of the metrics on the math.

656
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:30,326
seem to work out.

657
00:59:30,326 --> 00:59:38,766
too many cooks in the kitchen and like, I think for better or worse, some people have like
a vested interest in like trying to offer value, but unfortunately sometimes the value's

658
00:59:38,766 --> 00:59:39,777
not there.

659
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:47,767
Yeah, I mean, even to your point of like, well, let's have an on-call rotation that
everyone and say the team and the org could participate in, right?

660
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:52,509
150 people means you're on call for your product once every three years.

661
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:53,490
right.

662
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:55,371
So that doesn't work out, right?

663
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:59,453
So, you know, if your org is 50 people, then you get to the, once a year I'm on a call.

664
00:59:59,453 --> 01:00:08,898
Well, that maybe works out potentially if you have a low number of bugs, you deal with
real-time applications that can never really be down, highly resilient, and you run.

665
01:00:08,954 --> 01:00:18,893
you're probably running fire drills during working hours as if there were an incident to
know how to respond and not just hopefully waiting and never seeing a problem.

666
01:00:18,893 --> 01:00:25,026
Yeah, kind of like feel like computer systems like mirror a lot of like real life.

667
01:00:25,026 --> 01:00:29,628
whether it be like, would people who don't understand SRE, they're kind of like, in the
world do you do?

668
01:00:29,628 --> 01:00:33,029
I'm like, I'm basically like an emergency room doctor.

669
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:43,774
And like somebody comes into the emergency room, my responsibility is like, keep them
alive uh until the right person can come in and, you know, get them into like critical

670
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:44,735
condition.

671
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:49,133
Not even the surgeon, ah but you know, high level.

672
01:00:49,133 --> 01:00:55,248
I understand how patients work and the sets of problems that can happen and I can direct
people in the right places.

673
01:00:55,248 --> 01:00:58,378
keep the wet stuff on the inside and the dry stuff on the outside.

674
01:01:01,714 --> 01:01:04,294
You said you said nuclear physics.

675
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:07,086
Well, I don't think you said EMT, right?

676
01:01:07,086 --> 01:01:07,894
Right, right, right.

677
01:01:07,894 --> 01:01:08,706
Yeah.

678
01:01:08,759 --> 01:01:19,659
True, true, But I do spend, not that this qualifies my opinion by any means, but I do
spend a lot of time out in the wilderness.

679
01:01:19,659 --> 01:01:31,677
like the wilderness, the wilderness first aid stuff I've been exposed to is pretty much
that, keep the wet stuff on the inside, dry stuff on the outside.

680
01:01:31,677 --> 01:01:35,129
Okay, so now I'm imagining Bear Grylls.

681
01:01:35,668 --> 01:01:36,696
Ha ha ha!

682
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:44,817
I don't outback our frequently known on the internet means for drinking his own urine
unnecessarily.

683
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:49,595
But the likes he got, that's the metric.

684
01:01:50,465 --> 01:01:51,956
You gotta wonder what he was really going for.

685
01:01:51,956 --> 01:01:58,577
Was he going for teaching survival skills or was it just to become a paid influencer?

686
01:01:58,854 --> 01:02:01,162
I'm pretty sure he's got a mortgage to pay.

687
01:02:04,825 --> 01:02:05,920
Hahaha

688
01:02:07,419 --> 01:02:24,231
So um someone who's interested in pursuing a career in SRE, give us like your top rundown
pros and cons and um things you'd wish you, things you wished you had known before ending

689
01:02:24,231 --> 01:02:25,181
up here.

690
01:02:34,055 --> 01:02:28,250
There's a lot of different paths that you can take into SRE.

691
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:34,352
One thing I didn't really touch on and I know we're close on time so I won't go into it
too much is like a performance engineer.

692
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:39,715
That's very important for an SRE team to do performance testing of these kinds of things.

693
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:48,089
That's a huge part of SRE is like resource allocation and you performance testing in place
to better make those decisions.

694
01:02:48,089 --> 01:02:54,332
So performance engineering like I can say like from my background like coming in from
application engineering.

695
01:02:54,332 --> 01:03:01,486
there's a lot of value there because you understand how these microservice systems work
together.

696
01:03:01,786 --> 01:03:08,040
And then the systems engineer background has an ability to debug at the network level
really well and things like that.

697
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:13,873
And all of those things come in and offer value to an SRE team.

698
01:03:14,274 --> 01:03:17,115
I guess things I wish I would have known.

699
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:21,424
Kind like we talked about the beginning of the episode.

700
01:03:21,424 --> 01:03:30,164
I am like very much like go go go and Like early in my career everybody was like you're
gonna burn out like slow down.

701
01:03:30,164 --> 01:03:45,004
No, it's like impossible And I still say like I didn't burn out because I still like
absolutely love it But I really did not realize that like it actually did start to like

702
01:03:45,004 --> 01:03:48,598
the lack of sleep Just didn't start to kind of like

703
01:03:48,598 --> 01:03:51,639
a toll on my actual health a little bit.

704
01:03:52,260 --> 01:04:00,483
So like lesson learned to myself is like be be cognizant of like your personality and like
your

705
01:04:01,688 --> 01:04:09,081
you know, what some of your weaknesses might be there because like for me, I absolutely
love what I do and I want to be able to do this for a very long time.

706
01:04:09,081 --> 01:04:16,875
So I kind of came to this realization that I was like, whoa, like if you don't put and
management, like my manager was fine.

707
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:19,026
Like he would encourage me to do more of it.

708
01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:25,099
I'm like my director, like same thing, like, dude, like you need to take some time off.

709
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:31,682
ah So like my advice would be like, if you're more on that side of the spectrum, like know
yourself and

710
01:04:31,862 --> 01:04:37,385
yourself that time because it will make you better in the long run.

711
01:04:38,286 --> 01:04:53,365
Other things, I would just say like if it sounds interesting to you like don't shy away
from it because it is I feel like a huge there's like a huge surface of areas you can

712
01:04:53,365 --> 01:04:54,895
tackle but

713
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:01,243
If, I'm always like of the mindset like anybody can learn anything.

714
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:05,957
Obviously like some people are like more technically talented, they come in with more
experience, those sorts of things.

715
01:05:05,957 --> 01:05:09,529
But if it's interesting to you like and you have the drive, like go for it.

716
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:12,129
Those would be my biggest like two takeaways.

717
01:05:12,129 --> 01:05:19,931
And through the power of LLMs, now you too, everyone can be an expert in whatever topic uh
you fancy.

718
01:05:20,911 --> 01:05:29,533
mean, listening to you talk, Amy, about this really makes me think, like you say, you
really have to care a lot, but caring a lot means understanding the business and gives you

719
01:05:29,533 --> 01:05:33,064
an edge over everyone else who may not care as much.

720
01:05:33,064 --> 01:05:37,135
They won't give them a drive to really dive in and be able to make the right decision.

721
01:05:37,135 --> 01:05:40,594
But then there's the question that comes up of like, if you care too much,

722
01:05:40,594 --> 01:05:44,435
you're liable to burn out from doing that.

723
01:05:44,435 --> 01:05:49,476
And you really need to know yourself and that's a tall order, I think for a lot of people.

724
01:05:49,476 --> 01:06:02,796
Yeah, like it was very, it was a challenge for me to be like, you can't be the hero 24
seven, or like you are not going to be able to like sustain this.

725
01:06:05,876 --> 01:06:03,407
but.

726
01:06:03,407 --> 01:06:07,285
there's just one more fire over there that you know how to deal with.

727
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:08,127
Lord.

728
01:06:08,127 --> 01:06:08,377
Yeah.

729
01:06:08,377 --> 01:06:17,319
I mean, I guess I would say too, like I'm probably at a place now where the thing that I
did really enjoy is like I did get to serve in more of like an engineering manager role on

730
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:20,594
the SRE team towards the end of my last role.

731
01:06:20,594 --> 01:06:22,919
And, um.

732
01:06:22,919 --> 01:06:32,325
you know, everybody is like driven by different things, but you can kind of see people in
the org that have a lot of potential and uh starting to kind of like mentor them and hand

733
01:06:32,325 --> 01:06:42,701
things off to them and things like that can be very rewarding and is really like the best
thing you can do is it sounds like so hand wavy, but like fourth multiplier, like, you

734
01:06:42,701 --> 01:06:49,045
know, whether you're an actual manager or in a senior role or anything like that, like,

735
01:06:49,427 --> 01:06:56,274
What can you do to help the company and the teammates fall into the pit of success?

736
01:06:56,274 --> 01:06:57,867
I like that analogy.

737
01:06:58,158 --> 01:06:59,126
haha

738
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:02,018
Important leadership skill, learn to delegate, right?

739
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:12,924
You have to be okay at a certain point in your career with not being the hero because if
you're in that kind of role, sometimes your value is more so in enabling others and

740
01:07:12,924 --> 01:07:16,406
building out parts of the system that help others fall into the pit of success.

741
01:07:16,406 --> 01:07:22,430
And if you kind of are one of those people that uh feels like they always need like...

742
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:34,505
the recognition, then leadership type roles might not be the path for you because a lot of
the recognition is going to be hidden behind the scenes of enabling others.

743
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:37,666
Very true.

744
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:40,270
But it's warm, Kazooie, you like the girl and he likes it.

745
01:07:42,446 --> 01:07:50,590
I agree with you, but it's a, it's a completely different high, Probably not the best
analogy in the world, but that's the one that just like sticks in my head.

746
01:07:50,994 --> 01:08:01,344
It's more so like I would I guess I would almost equate it to like delayed gratification
like you're not gonna get the like that a girl in the moment but it might come like two

747
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:14,405
years later when somebody that you manage comes back to you and be like man like you
taught me this thing and I used it today and thank you and you're like oh

748
01:08:14,405 --> 01:08:23,818
interesting that you say that though, because that actually means that some of the most
enjoyment you get out of it, if that's the right word, is actually seeing others execute

749
01:08:23,818 --> 01:08:33,722
effectively and seeing back on what you've taught them, which indirectly has no impact on
the business in a way, especially if they leave and go somewhere else.

750
01:08:33,722 --> 01:08:37,903
you know, there is this weird uh paradox there.

751
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:40,066
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a little of both.

752
01:08:40,066 --> 01:08:41,088
Yeah, for sure.

753
01:08:41,088 --> 01:08:48,424
It's helping the business and hopefully you help other people on the team that help the
business or just go on and do good things themselves.

754
01:08:48,586 --> 01:08:51,626
I don't know if this is relevant, but this keeps coming to my mind in this conversation.

755
01:08:51,626 --> 01:09:01,206
There's this SMBC Saturday morning breakfast cereal webcomic issue where Superman's like,
how can I deliver the most value possible?

756
01:09:02,086 --> 01:09:09,506
And, and you know, the the mayor of the city is like, well, you know what actually saving
people like you're pretty slow at that if we look at it, you know, would really work is if

757
01:09:09,506 --> 01:09:17,057
we just had more energy to and to make this, you know, relevant for 2025 to obviously
power all of those LLMs to help people.

758
01:09:17,127 --> 01:09:22,000
And so can you just turn this one giant crank really fast as you can?

759
01:09:23,842 --> 01:09:25,703
That's just your whole life, just there.

760
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:28,115
like decades later, he's still turning the crank.

761
01:09:28,115 --> 01:09:34,289
And like, that's not a very rewarding experience, but that's what gives the most value to
uh civilization.

762
01:09:34,289 --> 01:09:41,754
And, you know, one day the years later, the mayor wakes up and says, you know what,
actually, we don't need you anymore.

763
01:09:41,855 --> 01:09:45,137
We automated your job away with uh nuclear fusion.

764
01:09:45,137 --> 01:09:50,026
And now we generate a limited energy all the time basically without doing anything, you
can just retire.

765
01:09:50,026 --> 01:09:52,070
Yeah, that's true.

766
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:54,335
Hopefully that doesn't happen.

767
01:09:54,335 --> 01:09:58,344
You're always having to invent new ways to make yourself valuable.

768
01:09:58,344 --> 01:10:00,091
part of being in tech.

769
01:10:00,091 --> 01:10:04,794
I don't see us running out anytime soon, which is good because I've got a mortgage to
cover.

770
01:10:04,794 --> 01:10:06,798
So I'm cool with that.

771
01:10:07,437 --> 01:10:10,565
See, I don't know why I just have the dissenting opinion here.

772
01:10:10,565 --> 01:10:14,433
I feel like there is just people making the same mistakes.

773
01:10:14,503 --> 01:10:16,345
Yeah, that's true too.

774
01:10:16,646 --> 01:10:18,638
same underlying mistakes.

775
01:10:18,638 --> 01:10:20,560
Yes, it's history repeating itself.

776
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,331
Yes.

777
01:10:21,412 --> 01:10:22,879
Yeah, because that's people disease.

778
01:10:22,879 --> 01:10:25,041
We still don't have like great ways to transmit

779
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:28,612
I tried, so I have tried to write down.

780
01:10:28,612 --> 01:10:36,135
So what happens frequently, I always thought I'd be doing engineering, but what I do is I
write blog posts and I record podcast episodes.

781
01:10:36,135 --> 01:10:44,307
And I get triggered sometimes while I'm doing other things in my life, talking with my
colleagues and whatnot in the communities that I'm in, so much so that I feel compelled to

782
01:10:44,307 --> 01:10:45,598
have to write something.

783
01:10:45,598 --> 01:10:50,319
And so there is a list of things out there of problems that I've seen and...

784
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:51,951
my recommendations for it.

785
01:10:51,951 --> 01:10:58,069
But some of them are like really nuanced thing, like this one particular little thing in
security that everyone seems to run into.

786
01:10:58,069 --> 01:11:04,888
And then there's like a 40 minute uh conference talk on it or a blog post on it that I'm
sure no one has ever read.

787
01:11:04,896 --> 01:11:05,990
Yeah

788
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:11,978
Well, it sounds like a really good point, put all those words together into one coherent
sentence.

789
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,340
Right?

790
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:19,393
That sounds like a really good time to move on picks and maybe you can point someone to
some of those resources.

791
01:11:19,393 --> 01:11:27,910
ah I'm not going to plug my blog as my pick, but I'm happy to put a link for this episode
for anyone that wants it.

792
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:36,667
Actually, I'll find the Saturday morning breakfast cereal uh episode two and put that, but
my pick actually is going to be based on our conversation.

793
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:41,812
There is a book by Peter Senge called The Fifth Discipline, and it's all about systems
thinking.

794
01:11:41,812 --> 01:11:48,587
And there's this one great example in the book about, ah it's a canonical thing that I
believe is taught at ah

795
01:11:48,587 --> 01:11:53,258
I think it's Harvard Business School, but also at MIT in the economics theory.

796
01:11:53,258 --> 01:12:04,701
that's basically there is a brewery that makes a beer and they make enough for a uh
distributor to sell the beer to retailers for people to buy it.

797
01:12:04,701 --> 01:12:10,363
And every retailer sells, like your local store sells two cases every week.

798
01:12:10,363 --> 01:12:17,515
And then in some random week, a new Pops on comes out and everyone loves the beer and
because

799
01:12:17,515 --> 01:12:20,146
the band mentions the beer in the song.

800
01:12:20,187 --> 01:12:27,632
And from that point on, every single retailer just increases the number of beers, the
cases that they sell by one to three.

801
01:12:27,632 --> 01:12:32,396
And this causes some ridiculous effects to happen throughout the whole ecosystem.

802
01:12:32,396 --> 01:12:41,092
The distributors will fall over, the brewery will get some massive orders, and basically
what ends up happening is lots of people will be fired for uh failing to deliver

803
01:12:41,092 --> 01:12:41,712
effectively.

804
01:12:41,712 --> 01:12:43,894
And it's just such a small change to happen.

805
01:12:43,894 --> 01:12:45,075
You can see huge impacts.

806
01:12:45,075 --> 01:12:45,736
And I feel like it's

807
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:51,096
it's a really interesting case study of what happens over and over again in lots of
organizations.

808
01:12:51,096 --> 01:12:53,810
And it relates to a lot of what I...

809
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:54,771
about in today's episode.

810
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:56,743
I thought it was relevant.

811
01:12:57,275 --> 01:12:58,275
That's pretty cool.

812
01:12:58,275 --> 01:13:00,035
That's called the fifth dimension.

813
01:13:01,495 --> 01:13:02,335
Fifth discipline.

814
01:13:02,335 --> 01:13:02,955
Gotcha.

815
01:13:04,275 --> 01:13:05,495
Right on.

816
01:13:06,335 --> 01:13:07,115
Jillian, what about you?

817
01:13:07,115 --> 01:13:08,113
What'd you bring for a pick?

818
01:13:08,113 --> 01:13:18,383
I know, I was gonna pick- I'm giving a talk next week on HPC, and now it occurs to me that
I don't know if that's gonna be like, recorded and put any place, so that's maybe not my

819
01:13:18,383 --> 01:13:18,743
pick.

820
01:13:18,743 --> 01:13:22,126
Um, I don't know, like Horizon Zero Dawn?

821
01:13:22,126 --> 01:13:24,188
That's the video game I've been playing.

822
01:13:24,669 --> 01:13:25,570
And maybe The Talk!

823
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:28,413
Maybe The Talk 2 if it's actually published and recorded.

824
01:13:28,413 --> 01:13:29,305
We'll see.

825
01:13:29,305 --> 01:13:38,554
You can always record it yourself on your laptop and then you'll have it, the transcript,
and can publish the slides and then you can release it to all your faithful audience

826
01:13:38,554 --> 01:13:39,187
there.

827
01:13:39,187 --> 01:13:39,712
Yeah.

828
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:40,092
true.

829
01:13:40,092 --> 01:13:42,548
I mean, I could just have somebody recorded on my phone, right?

830
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:43,453
Like, I don't know.

831
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:46,886
Okay, so we're gonna count on seeing your talk then.

832
01:13:46,886 --> 01:13:49,872
Yeah, sure, that's the point, it's supposed to be self-promotion.

833
01:13:50,589 --> 01:13:51,473
Right?

834
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:52,313
Right?

835
01:13:52,313 --> 01:13:53,378
what I do.

836
01:13:53,639 --> 01:13:55,347
Amy, I know you've done this before.

837
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:57,121
What do you have for a pick this week?

838
01:13:57,121 --> 01:14:03,241
Let's see, I was debating if I should pick something technical or non-technical.

839
01:14:03,241 --> 01:14:06,681
I guess I will try to break it up a little bit.

840
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:12,241
I'm going to pick a band that I am like absolutely obsessed with and I can't shut up about
it.

841
01:14:12,241 --> 01:14:17,601
And because other people won't listen to me anymore about it, this is a great opportunity
to share it.

842
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:21,941
My husband is really tired of me talking about them and blasting them.

843
01:14:21,961 --> 01:14:23,541
and then is Sleep Token.

844
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:27,027
I don't know if anybody has ever heard of it or heard of them, but I will

845
01:14:27,027 --> 01:14:28,167
drop a link.

846
01:14:28,868 --> 01:14:40,076
I first heard about them like maybe like two or three years ago and they have a bunch of
like new songs out this year and I am yeah it's when I've had like a long stressful day at

847
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:47,601
work I don't know why like I listen to them and it's like peaceful to me to fall asleep to
so whatever maybe other people will like it too.

848
01:14:47,601 --> 01:14:48,888
What's the genre?

849
01:14:49,469 --> 01:14:49,859
Us!

850
01:14:49,859 --> 01:14:50,990
That's the thing.

851
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:54,071
So they are like, they're all over the place.

852
01:14:54,071 --> 01:15:04,632
Like, I guess traditionally more like metal, but they're almost like a little bit like
EDM, a little bit metal, like honestly like a tiny bit hip-hop sometimes.

853
01:15:04,632 --> 01:15:14,009
Like they're just like, you listen to your song and you're like, oh this is like really
relaxing and then they start screaming and then they're and then it's like back like a

854
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,740
hip-hop kind of vibe and I'm just like what's happening?

855
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:18,709
ah

856
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:23,685
like, you're gonna say like, yeah, it's it's like Haydn ah or Dominic the Christmas
Donkey.

857
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,672
I just use that music to fall asleep at night.

858
01:15:25,672 --> 01:15:27,369
I'm just like, really?

859
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:32,355
Not my personal choice, but uh you know, if it works for you, that's uh pretty
interesting.

860
01:15:32,355 --> 01:15:33,852
I like metal, so maybe we'll check it out.

861
01:15:33,852 --> 01:15:36,345
why I absolutely love them.

862
01:15:36,345 --> 01:15:39,288
So yeah, that's gonna be my pick.

863
01:15:39,807 --> 01:15:40,378
That's awesome.

864
01:15:40,378 --> 01:15:45,850
I was just, as you were saying it, you're like, it's just what I want to listen to after a
long stressful day.

865
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:48,205
was like, this would be so great if it's a metal band.

866
01:15:48,205 --> 01:15:49,668
And then you're like, surprise.

867
01:15:49,668 --> 01:15:50,629
Guess what?

868
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:58,402
They're not metal in the sense of like, I really like this band Motionless and White, if
people have heard of them.

869
01:15:58,402 --> 01:16:00,404
They're not metal in that sense.

870
01:16:00,404 --> 01:16:03,366
They're like a little more chill than that, but yeah.

871
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:07,823
before we hang up.

872
01:16:10,618 --> 01:16:28,392
uh pick I switched it since we started recording because it's now a relevant topic on
Netflix there is a series called the Bear Grylls celebrity hunt and so it's all of these

873
01:16:28,392 --> 01:16:40,645
celebrities who are taken to Costa Rica and then they compete and the losers of the
competition have to go into this area that's like walled off

874
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:45,123
and they have to survive in there for one hour while Bear Grylls is hunting them.

875
01:16:45,123 --> 01:16:51,745
So they have an hour to either escape the bear pit or get caught by Bear Grylls.

876
01:16:51,745 --> 01:16:55,006
And it was actually just super fun to watch.

877
01:16:55,006 --> 01:17:03,129
And I brought it up at work saying, hey, for our next offsite, we should go to the bear
pit and have Bear Grylls hunt us down.

878
01:17:03,129 --> 01:17:06,481
where Bear Grylls will actually be well buttoned.

879
01:17:07,047 --> 01:17:08,653
I'd be cool with that, yeah.

880
01:17:08,681 --> 01:17:14,471
like that may create some sort of uh psychological safety issues for coming back to work
later.

881
01:17:14,471 --> 01:17:18,085
Yeah, there's probably a downside to that, but let's not focus on that.

882
01:17:18,969 --> 01:17:27,805
Makes me think my husband like at first I thought I was like what are you watching but he
watches this like I it's probably like a famous youtuber people probably know I can't

883
01:17:27,805 --> 01:17:35,551
think of him but like he's always out in the wilderness like doing things and my husband
loves watching him and initially I was like this is crazy but now I kind of like it too.

884
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:40,204
He's usually in Alaska I don't

885
01:17:41,521 --> 01:17:44,381
There been a lot of those episodes where my kids were watching something like that's
stupid.

886
01:17:44,381 --> 01:17:46,113
Why are you watching wasting your time on that?

887
01:17:46,113 --> 01:17:49,405
You know, like two hours later, I'm still sitting next to a watching it.

888
01:17:49,603 --> 01:17:52,024
But anyway, Amy, thanks for being on the show.

889
01:17:52,024 --> 01:17:53,585
This was a fun chat.

890
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:58,466
Thank you for your insights and your expertise and sharing your thoughts on SRE.

891
01:17:59,787 --> 01:18:03,416
Warren, Jillian, thank you both for jumping in and co-hosting today.

892
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:04,789
It's good to see you both.

893
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:08,080
And for all our listeners, thanks for listening.

894
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:08,546
We'll see you all
