<GuestCallout name="Paul Marston" link="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-marston-a669131/" image={GuestImage} brandImg={BrandImage} />

This week, Paul Marston from [Ankr](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ankr/) joins the crew to unpack the madness that is modern blockchain infrastructure. From his wild career transition out of financial services into 24/7 node ops for Web3, Paul shares the brutal truth about uptime expectations, decentralization challenges, and why hard forks are more like enterprise schema upgrades with a community twist. If you’ve ever wondered why managing a blockchain node is like owning a temperamental pet server, this one’s for you.

The team goes deep on the nitty-gritty of load balancing across dozens of chains, explaining why routing traffic to the “wrong” archive node could ruin your day—and how Ankr’s custom load balancer is basically magic for JSON-RPC calls. Warren tosses out wild scenarios about encrypted data smuggling via blockchain, while Will confesses his angry typing habit (yes, it’s back). The discussion gets even more fun with debates on innovation vs. rigor, Web2's forgotten best practices, and why testing in prod might not be such a dirty word after all.

But don’t think it’s all crypto and code. Paul shares battle-won wisdom from running over 100 chains across bare metal, giving us a peek at the operational sophistication and automation involved. From Terraform templates to Docker configs, he walks through the process of onboarding new chains and tuning for performance. The episode also touches on emerging risks like data exfiltration via public blockchains, and why AI (used wisely) might just be the sidekick DevOps always needed.

And of course memes, we talk a bit about this one:
