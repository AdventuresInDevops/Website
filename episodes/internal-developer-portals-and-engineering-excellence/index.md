In this episode, Will flies solo as Warren and Jillian are unavailable, but he's joined by Ganesh Datta, CTO and co-founder of Cortex. They dive deep into the world of Internal Developer Portals and how they contribute to engineering excellence. Ganesh shares his journey of co-founding a company, drawing from his experience at LendUp and how a chance college friendship led to the birth of the company.

The conversation covers the core benefits of developer portals, including solving ownership confusion, enabling production readiness, and providing engineering teams with a structured way to track services and responsibilities. Ganesh explains how developer portals compare to CRMs for sales teams—providing a centralized system to organize and improve efficiency. He also emphasizes how organizations should view engineering as a competitive advantage rather than a cost center.

We wrap up the discussion by exploring the future of developer portals, and how teams can adopt developer portals in a fail-fast, iterative way. The episode concludes with a lighthearted discussion about sleep tracking, the importance of reading before bed, and Socrates' legendary trolling skills.
