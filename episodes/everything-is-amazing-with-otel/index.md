In this episode, Will and Warren welcome Adriana Villela — CNCF ambassador, Dynatrace advocate, and host of the [*Geeking Out* podcast](https://www.linkedin.com/company/geeking-out-podcast/) — for a wide-ranging conversation on observability in CI/CD pipelines. Adriana shares her journey from “On Call Me Maybe” to her own podcast, her work with OpenTelemetry, and why observability isn’t just for SREs anymore.

The crew digs into how telemetry should be integrated across the software development lifecycle — from development to QA to production — and what that really looks like in modern teams. Adriana drops knowledge on CI/CD failures, distributed traces, and even how to bring observability to other parts of the business like recruiting and onboarding. She also explains how she got involved in the OpenTelemetry end-user SIG and what’s next for the observability movement.

Things get personal (and hilarious) as they trade war stories about SVN, terrible version control systems, reusable grocery bags, and the ethics of AI log parsers. Adriana closes with a powerful take: observability is a team sport, and the better we play it, the more effective — and environmentally conscious — our systems can become.
