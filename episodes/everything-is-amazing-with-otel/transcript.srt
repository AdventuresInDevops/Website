1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,803
for real this time.

2
00:00:01,803 --> 00:00:03,227
Warren, sound check.

3
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:05,171
I think I'm still here.

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,322
All right, you are welcome.

5
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:08,703
Glad to have you.

6
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:10,064
Jillian, hello.

7
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:18,502
Welcome back after your time jet setting around the world or whatever you were doing.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,571
I was helping somebody move last week.

9
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:27,395
So now that I like live back home with my family, I keep on being expected to be like a
real adult who shows up for things.

10
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:31,457
And it's, it's been quite the transition for me.

11
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:33,338
So there we go.

12
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:39,782
And then joining us today, Adriana, I forgot to ask how to pronounce your last name,
Valaila.

13
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:41,190
Vilella.

14
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,021
You're close.

15
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:43,311
it goes.

16
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:44,423
That's an E in there.

17
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:47,706
Yeah, I should probably have my glasses checked.

18
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:48,948
hey, welcome.

19
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,100
I'm glad to have you here.

20
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:53,934
So right on.

21
00:00:53,934 --> 00:01:00,280
So the big thing I want to shout out right away is you are the host of the Geeking Out
podcast.

22
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:02,112
Right on.

23
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:03,954
So tell us how that's going.

24
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:06,964
So I started the podcast.

25
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:11,040
say 2023.

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,761
I was in the fall of 2023.

27
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:23,536
It came on the heels of a previous podcast that I was doing through work with a former
coworker of mine, Anna Margarita Medina and our podcast.

28
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:25,707
And this was a work related podcast.

29
00:01:25,707 --> 00:01:27,333
And it had the best name.

30
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,369
It was called On Call Me Maybe.

31
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:31,770
Damn it.

32
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:35,182
It was like so much fun.

33
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,713
We had about two seasons of it.

34
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:38,353
I want to say it

35
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:40,675
like about 26 episodes.

36
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:44,737
And then we were no longer able to continue it.

37
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,329
So then I thought, well, I want to still keep podcasting.

38
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:49,871
So I started my own podcast geeking out.

39
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:54,468
And then I was because we used to have like an editor for on Call Me Maybe.

40
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:58,326
And I'm like, damn it, I don't know how to do any of this podcast editing stuff.

41
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:03,290
And my daughter, who I guess was 14 at the time, she's like, I'll help you out, mom.

42
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,910
So I'm like, OK.

43
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:08,303
So she helps me out with with the editing.

44
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:16,793
I've upped my editing game as well, but she's also designed the logo for it, which has
Capybatas, which I love.

45
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:17,238
I don't know.

46
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:22,121
They're just fun animals and I got introduced to them on Instagram.

47
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:23,892
I started like getting all these videos.

48
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:25,884
like, my God, where have you been all my life?

49
00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:30,106
So anyway, they're, they're like our mascot for the podcast.

50
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:31,907
They're adorable.

51
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:35,587
because I just scored a couple at mini so.

52
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:44,666
I don't know if you guys have that in the States, but yeah, it was, yeah, I was like, oh
my God, this is the best.

53
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:51,286
And yeah, and the podcast itself, I have it's it's a tech podcast.

54
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:53,526
I interview a lot of folks in tech.

55
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:59,506
I especially like to give voices to women and other underrepresented groups.

56
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:07,010
And I've had a I don't know, a combination of people who are both known, super well known
in the industry and and not

57
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,440
so well known.

58
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:12,133
So I guess my highest profile guest was Kelsey Hightower.

59
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:19,946
I've had Charity Majors, Liz Fong-Jones, Hazel Weekly, lots of fun guests.

60
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:26,249
And then other people that I've met along the way are where I'm like, you have such a cool
story, you should be on my podcast.

61
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:27,254
Right?

62
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:32,256
Like once you start a podcast, you're always, it feels like a sales role.

63
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:33,840
Like always be closing.

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,277
You know, you're always like trying to pull people into the show.

65
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:38,758
So true.

66
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:47,804
True, so you're also a CNCF ambassador and principal developer advocate at Dynatrace.

67
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:49,227
That's correct.

68
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,289
Right on.

69
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:51,452
Dynatrace is cool.

70
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:58,988
Like some of the stuff that they expose and dig into, it's like, wow, you went way deeper
into this than I wanted to go.

71
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:00,924
It's so true.

72
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:01,475
it's funny.

73
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:06,767
So I just, I just started my job at Dynatrace in November of last year.

74
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,538
So I'm pretty fresh.

75
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:17,454
And, you know, I, I, I came in because of my connection to the open telemetry community.

76
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:23,425
At my previous job, I was a developer advocate at LightStep, which had gotten acquired by
ServiceNow.

77
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:26,907
So I'd gotten into the open telemetry and observability community.

78
00:04:26,907 --> 00:04:29,948
And so when I joined Dynatrace, I'm like, well, you know, it's like,

79
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:32,860
also an observability vendor, but it's like so much more.

80
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,544
And so one of my, one of my coworkers, Andy Grabner, he's been with Dyna Trace forever.

81
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,194
I call him Mr.

82
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:47,320
Dyna Trace because he's like, he's so, he's so passionate about the platform and what we
do and, and, everything.

83
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,901
And he's really helped me.

84
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:58,417
He's given me a tour of the platform and we have this video series that started, it
started because he was like, Hey, you know, it would be good for you to like get to know

85
00:04:58,417 --> 00:04:59,567
the platform.

86
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:04,131
And every time he showed me new stuff, I'm like, dude, this stuff is so cool.

87
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:11,976
You know, it'd be really fun if we did like a YouTube reaction video series kind of thing
where you just like show me stuff for the first time and I react to it.

88
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:16,879
So then we started this video series called Dynatrace can do that with open telemetry.

89
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,623
And my reactions are are like au naturel because I can't act.

90
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:29,447
it's been it's been a fun way to learn about what the product does and also like share
share that same wonder.

91
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,752
the rest of the world.

92
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:32,673
yeah.

93
00:05:32,937 --> 00:05:35,779
Yeah, Dynatrace is like a gateway drug.

94
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:40,293
Like you come for the observability and then you're like, wow.

95
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,554
And then just go deep down the rabbit hole.

96
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:43,520
name sounds familiar.

97
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,814
Was Gravner on our show already?

98
00:05:46,814 --> 00:06:00,014
He was, yeah, I think it's been, actually I don't know how long ago, I had this
conversation with my wife the other day, I have three time periods in my life.

99
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:10,934
I can group things like prior to 1990, between 1990 and yesterday and today, and I can't
get any more granular than that.

100
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:11,701
you

101
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:19,316
I think that's one up on most of the population though, who knows like what happened five
minutes ago and that's it.

102
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:20,765
Bye.

103
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:21,745
true.

104
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,825
Also, I thought 1990 was like yesterday.

105
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:27,405
Like, where did the time go?

106
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:29,145
Oh my God.

107
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:34,205
No, no, it really depresses me when people are like, so I was like born in 1993.

108
00:06:34,205 --> 00:06:37,065
I'm like, oh, I was in my first year of high school.

109
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:37,672
Cool.

110
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:39,236
Yeah, right.

111
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:42,546
Cool.

112
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:49,135
So we were going to talk today about observability in the CI-CD platform.

113
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:52,498
So tell me a little bit about what that means to you.

114
00:06:53,193 --> 00:07:01,925
So I guess the main thing is I think when we talk about observability, there's still this
stigma, I guess.

115
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:07,837
I don't know if stigma is the right word, but we have this association that observability
is like an SRE concern, right?

116
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:20,660
that's when things go caca in prod, you turn to your observability solution and look
through the traces, the logs, the metrics to figure out what's going on and all that,

117
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,321
which is awesome.

118
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:30,871
You know, it's, it's so much more than that because first of all, it observability is a
team sport, right?

119
00:07:30,871 --> 00:07:35,453
In order for that telemetry to even get emitted in the first place.

120
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:47,477
And, it, yes, there's some telemetry that you automatically pick up from, from your
infrastructure and whatnot, but there's also the telemetry that has to be.

121
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:49,482
written by somebody, right?

122
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:52,643
So you're developers.

123
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:56,304
And so the developers have to care about observability, right?

124
00:07:56,304 --> 00:08:01,885
So now we're not seeing observability as just like, it's not just a necessary thing.

125
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:11,368
Someone had to put in that telemetry in order for us to be able to even have this
conversation of understanding what our system is doing.

126
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:13,169
And as

127
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:22,199
And we can take it a step further and say, well, you know, what if during the

128
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:27,913
software development life cycle, you know, developers instrument their code.

129
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:40,813
This gets handed off to QA and QA can use the observability data and say, Hey, I can use
this to troubleshoot my code or to troubleshoot the code that I'm testing.

130
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:47,913
And I can provide that feedback then to the developers and say, Hey, I found a bug and
this is what's happening.

131
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:50,193
Or they can say, Hey, I found a bug.

132
00:08:50,193 --> 00:08:52,093
I don't know why this is happening.

133
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:53,067
You need to instrument.

134
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:53,868
better.

135
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:59,031
So now we're like, we're shifting, we're shifting left, right on, on observability.

136
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:07,697
So we've got, so we've got the, development side, we've got the QA side, we've got the,
the production side with, with our SREs and whatnot.

137
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:21,066
But then there's also piece in the middle, which is, you know, our CI CD pipelines that
we've come to rely heavily on our CI CD pipelines to ensure that our code gets built and

138
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:23,067
our automated automated tests.

139
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:26,309
get run and stuff gets deployed to production.

140
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:27,170
Awesome.

141
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:38,017
But like what happens when that pipeline goes, Kaka, because that pipeline, even though
it's internal in itself, it is a production system.

142
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:46,983
So how frustrating is it when you've got, know, your ICD pipeline is working like a
well-willed machine and you're like, this is amazing.

143
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:52,887
And then you come to realize that suddenly one day something goes

144
00:09:52,887 --> 00:09:56,730
weird, some change was made and you have no idea why it's failing.

145
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:03,094
And wouldn't it be nice if we could also have observability into our CIICD pipelines.

146
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:15,522
And so we are starting to see a movement in that direction, which is amazing because now
we're no longer in the dark around around our CIICD pipeline.

147
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:19,284
this is for me, I think this is a really fascinating topic.

148
00:10:19,425 --> 00:10:23,257
I dug into it a little bit a couple of years back.

149
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:36,786
So I have this video course that I did with O'Reilly that came out last year, early last
year, and as part of it I'm like, hey I want to do something on observability of CI-CD

150
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:37,426
pipelines.

151
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:40,177
like just a short chapter on that.

152
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:42,279
And then I'm like starting to do some research.

153
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:45,341
like crap there's like nothing on this.

154
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,489
What the hell?

155
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:49,470
And then I was, I was messaging one of my friends in open telemetry.

156
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,931
We, we're both maintainers of the open telemetry and user SIG.

157
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:56,192
And we we've done a bunch of talks together.

158
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,402
She's, she's my hotel ride or die.

159
00:10:58,402 --> 00:11:02,022
Recently, we, we, we talk at KubeCon together all the time.

160
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:05,024
It's like, it's a great partnership and I'm messaging her.

161
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:11,396
like, you know, there's really not a lot of material out there on, the observability of
CICD pipelines.

162
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:14,333
She's like, that could be a really good talk topic.

163
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,577
I'm like, hmm.

164
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:16,845
So awesome.

165
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:20,145
we we put together we put together a talk.

166
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:23,365
think I want to say it was.

167
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:33,929
I want to say was KubeCon Chicago in 2023 that we talked, we did that talk for
observability day.

168
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:41,733
And it's been nice to see that space evolve over time.

169
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:49,857
I think there's now an official like CI CD SIG within open telemetry, I want to say.

170
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:54,579
So then there's actual like movement towards standardizing the observability

171
00:11:54,579 --> 00:12:04,066
around CI-CD because at the time when we were doing this stuff, when we were
investigating, it was this mishmash of tools that were available.

172
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:12,741
like, for example, depending on what tool used for CI-CD, so Jenkins, for example, had
some observability capabilities built in.

173
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:17,435
So it did emit some like, some hotel signals.

174
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:24,099
But then GitHub, if you wanted to have like observable GitHub actions, there's some like
homegrown

175
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:25,865
options, but.

176
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:30,367
Now that means you're having to rely on someone else maintaining that.

177
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:37,410
If you want to have observable CI CD pipelines and then what if they stopped maintaining
those GitHub actions or, or they discontinued.

178
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:37,931
Right.

179
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:47,945
So like that, that's a little bit scary if you want to rely on that, GitLab at the time
when we're investigating, they, they were starting, they, they were having conversations

180
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:50,236
around standardizing around that.

181
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:55,759
Ansible at the time, I think, they, had like an, an hotel.

182
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:07,599
in so you can have like when you're when doing your your Ansible playbooks you have some
observability around that and then there's there is I want to say

183
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:15,216
There was like an hotel, I forget now what it's called, but basically you could have hotel
for bash.

184
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:17,328
And it was funny.

185
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:19,699
were, we were talking about this at our talk.

186
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:31,305
then later at that KubeCon recent, met the person who, who, who created that Amy Toby
from, she used to work at Equinix, but she created that tool.

187
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:37,949
like, my God, like mega fangirling because I'm like, we talked about your tool and you're
here.

188
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:48,385
So when we talk about observability in the CI-CD pipeline, what kind of metrics or
insights are you looking to expose there?

189
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:55,272
you're wanting to look at things like how long you're spending on, your builds.

190
00:13:59,117 --> 00:14:05,800
how long you're spending like at each stage of your pipeline, example, identifying
pipeline failures.

191
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,420
That's another thing.

192
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:18,855
And being able to standardize it with open telemetry in particular, because I think that's
the main thing too is because like a lot of, I would say a lot of the industry has moved

193
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:26,528
towards standardizing on open telemetry, making sure that then we're still continuing to
speak that same language, right?

194
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:36,669
Gotcha, yeah, so then you still have access to all of those same insights, but you get it
from your same observability tool that you get all of your other metrics from.

195
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:37,880
Exactly, exactly.

196
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:48,446
And also like, you you add distributed tracing into the mix and all of a sudden now you're
also able to have this nice visualization of like your build pipeline, right?

197
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:57,421
You can see like all of the stages nicely as well through your observability vendor, which
I think is really cool.

198
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:04,758
I think every company I worked for had a pretty good hands-on strategy for managing
observability of their pipelines.

199
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:09,943
Whenever it failed, someone got an email and then they went to the product and they
clicked retry.

200
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:14,628
And desperately look at

201
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:17,652
meeting and somebody's like, shouldn't this have been done already?

202
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:21,397
And then I go and I check the pipeline and I'm like, well, it should have, but it failed.

203
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:22,528
And so it didn't.

204
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:25,595
And then, and I'm going to, I'm going to look into that for you.

205
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:27,114
You didn't even have the emails.

206
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:29,199
Yeah, that's like step one.

207
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,043
no, it's just it's too many emails and then I turn them off.

208
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:38,694
It's like how every like messaging platform is really great until everybody's on there and
then I get too many messages and then I and then I turn it off.

209
00:15:38,694 --> 00:15:40,375
It's like it's the same thing.

210
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,047
let's go the horror story route.

211
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:48,885
So the one I know is we were using SVN at the time, so already a great start.

212
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:50,107
damn.

213
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:57,955
And this was an upgrade from what my previous company had been doing, which was no source
control for their source code.

214
00:15:57,955 --> 00:16:04,079
this was, yeah, this was like, wow, actually there is a company that knows how to do
source control.

215
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:08,204
Because I had been using Git for a lot of years before that.

216
00:16:08,204 --> 00:16:11,446
And so I was shocked that this is what the state of the industry was.

217
00:16:11,494 --> 00:16:20,734
Ah, but the genius thing was that you couldn't figure out, like you knew who the committer
was for each failure, but you had no idea if it was like their fault.

218
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:29,994
So the genius thing was that they converted it so that when an email went out, they tried
to dynamically figure out who made the change that actually caused the problem so that

219
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:32,154
they could actually put the right people in the email.

220
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:36,754
And like this was a, this is not a trivial thing, especially if there's like, you know,
multiple things going on.

221
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:40,834
have 2000 engineers committing to the same monorepo.

222
00:16:41,806 --> 00:16:43,616
Yeah, I don't work there anymore.

223
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:44,703
Hahaha!

224
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,033
Did you say 2000?

225
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,796
2000 engineers?

226
00:16:47,997 --> 00:16:51,011
Is that like real or is that is that hyperbole?

227
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,663
Because that's that's a lot of engineers to be.

228
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:54,791
Yeah.

229
00:16:54,791 --> 00:17:00,224
I mean, there's like, mean, monoliths and monorepos like this is the, this is the Google
way, right?

230
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:03,205
There, I think there's the two trains of, of companies here.

231
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:05,956
The ones that go well-oiled monolith on one side.

232
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:09,278
And I mean, right before well-oiled monolith, there's like distributed monolith.

233
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:14,080
And then on the other side is microservices everywhere and individual repositories.

234
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,372
So the closer you get to the monolith side, the more you have just engineers thrown into
the problem.

235
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:21,263
I think Google last check was like over a hundred thousand or something.

236
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:22,664
Like it's, it's a

237
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:26,180
massive number that these companies try to make happen.

238
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,477
So 2000 is not that big in my experience.

239
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:33,904
That's wild.

240
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:34,906
Okay.

241
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:40,478
I worked at a place that used this version control tool called harvest.

242
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:45,272
I don't know if, if you guys have heard of it, it was, it was.

243
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,198
ones that I've seen and Harvest is not on that list.

244
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:50,603
And it was like such a piece of crap.

245
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:56,156
And it was one of those ones too, where you had to like check in, check out the file.

246
00:17:56,156 --> 00:18:00,557
like, that file was checked, checked out, you know, no one, no one could touch it.

247
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:15,274
And I mean, it was better than, I, I, I'd worked at places where we had a, a network drive
with the source code and pray, pray that someone didn't overwrite your, your work.

248
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,373
So at least by default, even on Windows, there's a little bit of conflict resolution.

249
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:30,259
But before I convinced my company to move to Git at the time, they were using, before SVN,
they were actually using Perforce by Microsoft.

250
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,821
And that didn't have file conflict resolution.

251
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:40,745
So if two people committed a file at the same time, it would literally crash the entire
database and you were not restoring your source code.

252
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:42,568
Right on.

253
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:46,188
Now has anyone ever used clear case?

254
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:48,554
No.

255
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:55,788
going to tell us that you have an hotel for every single source code tool that's out
there.

256
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:57,691
my God, wouldn't that be something?

257
00:18:57,691 --> 00:19:01,896
But Clearcase, think they were bought by IBM at some point.

258
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:15,174
It was the most ridiculous source control system ever because you had to write like
configurations for being able to do the source control.

259
00:19:15,274 --> 00:19:24,114
So it was like akin to like, you know, on mainframes where you have to write the JCL to
like run your code.

260
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,954
It was kind of like that.

261
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:29,794
It was like so archaic and like it hurt my brain.

262
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,858
And I'm like, I don't want to touch version control ever.

263
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:35,133
again after this experience.

264
00:19:35,537 --> 00:19:39,867
And then we moved to Git and I'm like, thank God someone understands me.

265
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:57,539
So whenever we're talking about putting observability in a CI-CD platform, are there
specific plug-ins or specific tools that help you instrument this?

266
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:04,259
Or are we talking about just like using Bash and Netcat to fire off data to an endpoint?

267
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:18,713
So if your CI CD tool supports it, then I would definitely say use whatever plugins are
available, the official plugins.

268
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:22,456
Use that because I think that'll give you some good insights.

269
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:32,741
But barring that, is, for example, there is a plugin for Java around.

270
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:38,907
like specific for Java builds, I believe.

271
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:45,453
That gives you some additional CI CD insights or stuff like around Maven and Gradle.

272
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:52,942
And then there's this, I'm trying to remember now what the hotel bash thing is called.

273
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:56,024
I'm going to just Google this quickly, hotel bash.

274
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:07,611
yeah, open telemetry CLI, O-Tel CLI.

275
00:21:09,797 --> 00:21:11,240
That is what it is called.

276
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:20,030
that one is probably pretty popular because I mean let's just be honest most of your CI CD
stuff is just a bash command.

277
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,422
no, don't say that.

278
00:21:21,422 --> 00:21:22,947
Don't say that.

279
00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:25,370
I still

280
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,990
you have to at least be using like e-grip, right?

281
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,767
you can definitely use that.

282
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:32,302
It's, it'll at least give you something.

283
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:39,020
What do you have to instrument within the pipeline?

284
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,483
So I think we talked a little bit about.

285
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:49,761
the let's say the steps or the jobs or the workflows that you have and the amount of time
that they're spending in each one of them or like where the failures end up being

286
00:21:49,761 --> 00:22:01,617
especially for I mean, CIT pipelines are notoriously flaky in some way like maybe the
package repository is down or the machine runs out of memory or gets killed because GitHub

287
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:06,440
thinks that you're running a crypto miner on there or any and never other things.

288
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,612
like, you know, one step above that though, there's a lot that goes on during the CIT.

289
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:19,891
ICD pipelines and I can imagine there's tools like you have you mentioned a bunch like you
know say Ansible but obviously there's I see stuff maybe you know you're building

290
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:29,632
artifacts and whatnot how hard is it to get into all of those tools and get all that
telemetry data to actually you know export it out somewhere even if the platform supports

291
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,582
them.

292
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:43,156
So one of the things that we explored was there's this component of, so for, I don't know
how familiar you are with open telemetry.

293
00:22:45,008 --> 00:22:46,890
you're gonna get a range of in the audience here.

294
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:53,106
Like there are some that are gonna be experienced and on the other side may have no idea
what you mean when you even say, tell.

295
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:54,544
All right, so.

296
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:59,238
So basically OpenTelemetry, there's like a couple of parts.

297
00:22:59,238 --> 00:23:01,499
There's like the API and SDK.

298
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:07,102
So use that to instrument your code.

299
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:13,525
So you go into like your Java and Python code or whatnot, and there's like a bunch of OTA
languages that are supported.

300
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,615
And you go in and you write the instrumentation.

301
00:23:15,615 --> 00:23:22,588
So that means like you're manually typing in, like this is where I want to insert my
traces, my logs, my metrics.

302
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:25,750
There's also automatic instrumentation.

303
00:23:26,513 --> 00:23:30,502
and where basically there's like

304
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:43,146
essentially like a wrapper around your code that as long as you're using like like popular
libraries like Python Flask, for example, it'll it'll automatically generate some

305
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:50,649
telemetry like some traces for for for your code there for any code like using using that
library.

306
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:54,531
But then there's another component in OpenTelemetry, which is the hotel collector.

307
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:58,053
So that's a vendor neutral agent, basically.

308
00:23:58,053 --> 00:24:00,474
And you can think of it as like an ETL tool.

309
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:00,834
So it'll

310
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:04,216
will extract the telemetry from multiple sources.

311
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:13,501
So the sources can be like your application telemetry can be your infrastructure telemetry
from various, various things at the same time.

312
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:23,666
And then there's processors, which basically can, you know, massage your data, you can add
attributes, remove attributes, you can do some, some transformations.

313
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:27,788
So for example, you know, your

314
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:35,874
using like underscores in your naming conventions for your attributes, but you're, you
want to switch to like dot notation.

315
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:36,615
Use that.

316
00:24:36,615 --> 00:24:37,876
you do.

317
00:24:38,088 --> 00:24:46,011
you do that in the collector and then it gets sent somewhere and you can send it to
multiple somewheres at the same time with the collector.

318
00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:57,877
basically this enables you to for example, if you don't have like an all in one tool that
can ingest all of your telemetry that you're collecting, then you can send it like to one

319
00:24:57,877 --> 00:25:00,839
tool for traces, one for logs, one for metrics.

320
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,899
I don't recommend that.

321
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:08,022
Ideally you want everything sitting in the same in the same backend because then you know,
you have like your single source of truth and all the

322
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:14,851
correlated data, if that's your setup, the OpenTelemetry collector allows you to do that.

323
00:25:15,312 --> 00:25:20,318
Now I'm trying to think of where I was going with that when we're talking about the
collector.

324
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:24,242
Yeah.

325
00:25:24,242 --> 00:25:25,242
have three components here.

326
00:25:25,242 --> 00:25:31,015
You have your code that's emitting traces or data or logs, and you have someplace where
you wanna see them.

327
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:34,587
You know, maybe it's your Grafana's, your Elastic Searches of the world.

328
00:25:34,587 --> 00:25:36,497
And you could have a custom protocol.

329
00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:45,662
And for a long time, you had a custom protocol, custom libraries on the software
development side to get that log information from the source to the sync, to the target

330
00:25:45,662 --> 00:25:47,052
where you want it to go.

331
00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:50,254
And that means that every time you wanted to change which

332
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:57,336
you were utilizing or which language or which team you're working on, you needed to find a
new library for that new thing that you were utilizing.

333
00:25:57,336 --> 00:26:01,132
Wouldn't it be great if there was some sort of standard that made this all easy?

334
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:02,528
That's O-Tel for me.

335
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:03,452
Mm hmm.

336
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:05,750
Yeah, essentially, essentially.

337
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,161
Yeah.

338
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:12,744
is making sure that every single thing that you were utilizing could be supported.

339
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:15,326
For instance, you mentioned Python Flask.

340
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:20,590
You know, it's great that there's a library out there that you can throw into Python Flask
or if it's supported by Flask by default.

341
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:24,833
And it just works because the output of those logs matches the standard.

342
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,884
But I can imagine there's lots of tools that you could be using.

343
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:31,497
You brought up, you know, bash CLI as one of them, which, you know, don't have these
things by default.

344
00:26:31,497 --> 00:26:34,939
My example would be, you know, let's assume everyone's using Open Tofu today.

345
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:35,867
Mm-hmm.

346
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:39,044
What is, what does that look like?

347
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:51,592
know, it like does do these tools ISE offer configuration to make it easy to do that or is
it a matter of like having to parse, you know, output, you know, raw text output and get

348
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:52,643
it converted.

349
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:54,989
Yes, now I remember where I was going with that.

350
00:26:55,089 --> 00:27:01,631
Yeah, so like for example, one thing that a lot of these tools have in common is that they
emit logs, right?

351
00:27:01,732 --> 00:27:13,936
And so you can, so the Othel collector has this component called the file logs receiver,
where it can basically ingest logs and it'll parse out your logs given like some rejects

352
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:15,198
expressions.

353
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:19,701
so that you can do something useful with the data and send that to your your hotel back
end.

354
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:31,978
So that's where you, know, things that aren't necessarily like have hotel baked in, you
can kind of turn it hotel-esque and get it to send you send the hotel data that you need

355
00:27:31,978 --> 00:27:35,080
to hopefully troubleshoot a little bit better.

356
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:44,404
So Will was about to make this joke, but I'm going to steal it from him because you, you,
I think fundamentally it's like, Oh, I have a problem.

357
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:47,044
The solution I know it's to use regex.

358
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:50,664
And when you think that the solution is regex, now you have two problems.

359
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:54,901
I know I always have to look up rejects anything

360
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:11,035
I mean, I think this is where log4j, the exploit ended up coming from is having to parse
literally log messages that were coming from everywhere and you could get it to execute

361
00:28:11,035 --> 00:28:12,357
arbitrary code because of it.

362
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:21,605
And, you know, there's just a number of huge gotchas there that if you'd not really
experienced, especially parsing logs that you'll end up in situations with your rejects

363
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:25,128
will like literally crash due to catastrophic backtracking.

364
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:40,511
So that's something I hadn't thought of when we first started talking about this.

365
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:45,473
I was thinking about during the CI-CD process, there's the build time.

366
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:57,929
But then there's also time associated with Terraform, going off and doing Terraform
things, which can be really significant at times.

367
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:01,021
Because sometimes Terraform decides to.

368
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,214
just completely delete and rebuild this thing from scratch.

369
00:29:05,214 --> 00:29:09,021
You're like, God, dude, I just wanted you to change this parameter.

370
00:29:09,021 --> 00:29:12,855
And so this could be a really good way of exposing that.

371
00:29:13,214 --> 00:29:14,455
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

372
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:23,443
It's it's all of a sudden, like, you're able to see the things that you weren't seeing
before necessarily.

373
00:29:23,443 --> 00:29:23,693
Right.

374
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:36,113
So it's not just the troubleshooting, troubleshooting when things go bad, but also like,
can I use this information now to further optimize?

375
00:29:36,113 --> 00:29:40,887
And even the other part, too, which is like you think it's going OK.

376
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:43,566
And you find out otherwise, right?

377
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:51,814
Like behind the scenes, something very bad is happening that wouldn't have necessarily
been exposed because there's like no catastrophic failure of your pipeline.

378
00:29:51,814 --> 00:29:58,459
As far as you're concerned, it's completing and things are, you know, getting delivered,
built and whatever.

379
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:07,827
That's one of my favorite phrases to hear is, that error message is okay.

380
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:14,335
No, no, just the fact that you called it an error message makes it not okay.

381
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:16,036
Can we agree on that?

382
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,989
Yeah, exactly.

383
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,300
So I think because we're in engineering discipline, you we have to be cognizant of this.

384
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:28,460
And if we have new data available, new metrics that we're able to track, it's going to
create a signal that causes us to make a change.

385
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:41,000
And so one of the questions I want to ask you is, do you feel like that O-Tel has caused a
shift in the mindset or focus areas that we've been dealing with in the last, let's say,

386
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,060
before up into this point?

387
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,000
So I'm not sure exactly how old it is.

388
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,080
I want to say it's like five years now, although that may be that it's a little bit
shorter.

389
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,820
that's about right.

390
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,560
It started in 2019.

391
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,835
So, yeah.

392
00:30:51,835 --> 00:31:01,878
so before that you know we didn't have it he's like has there been some fundamental shift
with how we're tackling problems in the observability space and you said shift left so

393
00:31:01,878 --> 00:31:06,820
really development teams engineering teams in general compared to what we were doing
beforehand.

394
00:31:07,294 --> 00:31:15,546
I mean, I think with, with O-Tel because so pre pre O-Tel, like it was kind of a free for
all.

395
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:18,479
And there had been attempts at standardization, right?

396
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:25,612
Because there was open census on the one side from Google and then open tracing from CNCF.

397
00:31:26,353 --> 00:31:30,314
and then like each vendor also had their own thing.

398
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:34,156
and so I think there's a lot of

399
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:41,244
time and effort expended into, you know, maintaining these like instrumentation libraries.

400
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:47,908
And now with OTEL, I think the conversation has shifted because we're like, okay, this is
the single standard.

401
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,420
We all agree that it's going to work this way.

402
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:59,396
And now we're not using like, you know, not it's not a single organization or individual
organizations using their brain power, like

403
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:06,957
I'm going to say in air quotes, wasting their time on instrumentation libraries because
we're all like as competitors working together towards a common goal.

404
00:32:06,957 --> 00:32:19,153
now we're, we're, you know, combining brains towards a singular purpose, which means then
we're, we've essentially democratized data in the sense that now all of these

405
00:32:19,213 --> 00:32:23,335
observability tools are ingesting the same data.

406
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:29,748
And so the differentiator is what do they do with your data in a way that is helpful

407
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,279
to you, right?

408
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,412
And the answer to that question varies, right?

409
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:43,087
Because what's meaningful to me might not be the same, might not be as important to you.

410
00:32:43,347 --> 00:32:54,394
And I think the other thing that OTEL provides that like open census and open tracing
didn't provide at the time was this unified view of traces, logs, and metrics where now we

411
00:32:54,394 --> 00:32:56,075
have this ability.

412
00:32:56,696 --> 00:32:59,708
First of all, we have a standard for these three signals, but

413
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:03,239
also we have correlation of the three signals.

414
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:14,982
And I think the correlation is really important because I, for me, the backbone of
observability is the distributed trace because it tells the story right end to end.

415
00:33:15,382 --> 00:33:17,282
And then you've got the supporting actors.

416
00:33:17,282 --> 00:33:23,304
We've got the metrics that give us an idea of things like our CPU usage and our

417
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:35,105
RAM usage or how long we've spent on a particular process or even having an idea of like,
hey, I sold like 50 telescopes last month compared to this month.

418
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:41,318
And then our logs that are our point in time indicators, right?

419
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:47,721
And all these things separate are like, yeah, that's cool, that's useful.

420
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:51,243
But together, like they paint that full picture, right?

421
00:33:51,243 --> 00:33:53,874
We have this very rich understanding.

422
00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:56,345
of what's happening with our systems.

423
00:33:56,345 --> 00:34:01,858
I think that's the thing that observability brings us.

424
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:14,585
I'm going to borrow a definition of observability that I really like from Hazel Weekly, is
observability allows us to ask meaningful questions, get useful answers, and act

425
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,286
effectively on the information that we get.

426
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:20,488
And I think we are

427
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:23,161
We are getting to that point.

428
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:33,887
I'm not, I don't think we're fully there in the same way that like, you know, so many
organizations back in the day and maybe even to a certain extent now, or like we're doing

429
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:36,619
DevOps because we have a CI CD pipeline.

430
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:42,642
It's like, have observability because we are collecting metrics and sending them to blah
back end.

431
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:45,904
It's like, you're, you're on your way.

432
00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:48,676
We're not there yet.

433
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:49,535
getting there.

434
00:34:49,535 --> 00:34:55,465
I think the real question now is can we have an AI agent that will look through your logs
and tell you what the problem is?

435
00:34:55,465 --> 00:34:57,195
Because that's what I think I need.

436
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,976
I don't want to be reading logs.

437
00:34:58,976 --> 00:35:04,164
vendors and that is a fair ask and I think a lot of vendors are moving in that direction.

438
00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:05,938
I mean, including Dynatrace.

439
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:09,784
Dynatrace has an AI assistant named Davis AI.

440
00:35:09,812 --> 00:35:10,706
just real quick, if

441
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:20,002
Well, I guess that's the success of Oatel is because now you can shop around for the
provider that offers you that exact benefit without feeling like you lose your data or

442
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:28,167
have to spend engineering time to actually adhere to whatever backwards protocol that that
provider is offering.

443
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:31,150
Yeah, but like biologists don't like paying for stuff.

444
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,511
Well, know what it means.

445
00:35:33,511 --> 00:35:41,586
When you say they don't like paying for stuff, what they mean is they don't like paying
for stuff when that money has clear price tags on it, but when there's suspect value

446
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:50,022
associated with running it yourself on on-prem hardware, then they have no problem
shelling out hundreds of thousands of dollars for it.

447
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:50,493
that's true.

448
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:52,486
I mean, we can still have on-site HPCs.

449
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:53,778
Like, that's fine.

450
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:55,450
That's totally fine.

451
00:35:55,718 --> 00:36:08,304
just throw a Grafana in your cluster and you can use your hotel collector and point it at
that and you'll get all your data into whatever you're saying that Grafana is pointed at

452
00:36:08,304 --> 00:36:09,565
and you're good to go.

453
00:36:10,662 --> 00:36:16,741
I mean, sometimes, but not all the platforms that I use have all these nifty tools built
into them.

454
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:21,558
The AWS healthcare pipeline platform does not have this stuff built in.

455
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:23,630
It just sends everything to CloudWatch.

456
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:27,416
And then it's like, well, good luck with that.

457
00:36:27,947 --> 00:36:32,380
I think you started that problem definition with the problem AWS.

458
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:40,720
No, AWS is, listen, I'm still on my grifting, AWS, pay my bills, please.

459
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,900
So we can't bad talk them because every once in a while they do throw some credits my way.

460
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,020
So I love you, AWS.

461
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:53,328
if you stick around for the end of the episode, I actually have something to say about AWS
credits.

462
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,270
we'll get there.

463
00:36:57,252 --> 00:37:00,455
Well, Jillian, unfortunately, you're going to be excluded from this.

464
00:37:01,256 --> 00:37:08,423
well, I wonder why a host of this podcast is going to be excluded from a giveaway we're
having.

465
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:08,802
So

466
00:37:08,802 --> 00:37:10,947
Well, okay, that's cool.

467
00:37:11,407 --> 00:37:12,428
Damn it.

468
00:37:13,322 --> 00:37:14,557
Fine.

469
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,754
So one of the things I want to dig into, I see the benefits of this.

470
00:37:24,713 --> 00:37:37,842
Where I struggle with implementation, though, like the developers I support, they see the
benefits of this, but only after I build the whole thing for them and show it to them.

471
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:45,846
So what are some ideas you have to get them excited?

472
00:37:46,004 --> 00:37:51,177
to kind of like throw a few hours of their own time towards getting this implemented.

473
00:37:52,897 --> 00:38:03,343
I think, I think one way to be effective with this is making developers responsible for
their code and prod, like right after, right after it's deployed.

474
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,745
nothing lights the

475
00:38:06,776 --> 00:38:10,236
Nothing tells a story like staring at a screen at 2 a.m.

476
00:38:10,236 --> 00:38:12,643
knowing that you're the reason you're there.

477
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:15,244
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

478
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:20,688
I think another thing exactly, right?

479
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:33,218
But another thing that I was going to say, you know, back to what I was saying in the
beginning about QAs using that telemetry also during the testing phase to be able to

480
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:42,394
identify bugs in testing, making basically making telemetry quality gate.

481
00:38:42,674 --> 00:38:46,941
So before going into QA, you

482
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:55,546
it's basically mandatory to have instrumented your code, otherwise you don't pass go,
basically.

483
00:38:56,026 --> 00:38:58,638
That's another way to incentivize.

484
00:38:58,638 --> 00:39:07,601
And I think one way to think about it, and I think this is where people have a bit of a
hard time, like wrapping their brains around it.

485
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:15,425
I see instrumenting code as no different than like, you know, we're writing print
statements all the time and we write log statements.

486
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:18,246
So like you're already writing logs.

487
00:39:18,966 --> 00:39:21,027
So do it the open telemetry way.

488
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:25,809
You're already like that's part of your mindset.

489
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:30,292
adding, adding traces here and there isn't a terrible idea.

490
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:35,234
Especially if it can help you as well as a developer, debug your own code.

491
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:37,365
And I think that's, that's another value add.

492
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:38,165
It's like.

493
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:46,956
my god, I have more insight when I'm writing my code to understand why this like weird
error keeps happening like every 50 runs of the program.

494
00:39:46,956 --> 00:39:50,269
Like wouldn't that be nice?

495
00:39:50,405 --> 00:39:54,168
I think you could put your perspective though on the controversial side, right?

496
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:57,370
Like, I mean, maybe there are the engineers out there that they don't write any bugs.

497
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,321
There's no production never goes down.

498
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:00,822
There's no incidents, whatever.

499
00:40:00,822 --> 00:40:03,874
And then, and then, you know, this isn't a value added activity.

500
00:40:03,874 --> 00:40:10,659
So, you know, if they're out there and they're thinking to themselves, all my code is
absolutely perfect and I'm not accountable for it.

501
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,181
I don't know there can be another argument.

502
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:13,983
I know.

503
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:17,789
Well, what can you do to question perfection like that?

504
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:25,491
You did say something interesting though, which is basically what you're advocating for
here, which is shift left on telemetry.

505
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:35,744
And one of the complaints that I've heard from my colleagues across the industry have
been, well, there's like shift left testing and shift left telemetry and shift left

506
00:40:35,744 --> 00:40:36,734
security.

507
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:40,575
And now we're doing infrastructure as code instead of release engineering.

508
00:40:40,575 --> 00:40:44,526
I mean, at some point, like if everything is shift left, there's nothing left.

509
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:47,317
Like everything is now on the right, right?

510
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:50,784
Hahaha!

511
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:53,425
I mean, yeah, you're right.

512
00:40:53,425 --> 00:41:03,365
But like, I guess the way I look at it is, but if you're like, if you don't you fluff,
then it's going to be so much more painful after.

513
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:07,245
I don't, I don't, I don't know.

514
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:08,565
Maybe, maybe it's me.

515
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:11,245
Like my personality, I like learning new tech.

516
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:13,005
it's like, you got to learn.

517
00:41:13,257 --> 00:41:15,477
know, Terraform, yay, that's awesome.

518
00:41:15,477 --> 00:41:16,437
You got to learn Docker.

519
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:17,057
Yay.

520
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:17,957
Cool.

521
00:41:18,997 --> 00:41:27,297
I think, think honestly, for this to succeed, you almost, you have to come in with that
right mindset and, and

522
00:41:28,073 --> 00:41:31,893
There's no better way to do that than with like fresh young blood, right?

523
00:41:31,893 --> 00:41:38,553
The new folks coming into the industry, like that, that is the way, you know, that, that
is the way that it works.

524
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:42,553
But for the older folks, you're like, oh, you're telling me now I have to do all this
extra crap.

525
00:41:42,553 --> 00:41:43,953
Oh, damn it.

526
00:41:43,953 --> 00:41:49,422
I like how you stopped after Terraform and Docker and you didn't say, we have to use
Kubernetes, yay.

527
00:41:51,765 --> 00:41:54,588
Kubernetes and I have a love hate relationship.

528
00:41:56,693 --> 00:41:57,973
I know, right?

529
00:41:58,922 --> 00:41:59,848
We all do.

530
00:41:59,848 --> 00:42:08,212
So, I mean, that's an interesting perspective that those that are more experienced are
likely I don't I want to say that they're, you know, thinking the wrong direction or have

531
00:42:08,212 --> 00:42:17,366
the not the right mindset, but they're focused in the areas where they think has the most
value, like maybe the experience helps tell them what they need to do more effectively.

532
00:42:17,366 --> 00:42:21,858
And if you are looking at something and say, well, I don't know how to test this
effectively.

533
00:42:21,858 --> 00:42:24,129
And I don't know how to make this super secure.

534
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:29,782
And I don't know where my bugs are going to be, then you do want to take all of these
steps, at least a little bit in each one.

535
00:42:29,782 --> 00:42:30,563
these directions.

536
00:42:30,563 --> 00:42:41,783
And that isn't to say you need to design the perfect platform, having the logs end up on
an ephemeral like on hard disk of an ephemeral compute environment, isn't going to help

537
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:44,285
you when there's a problem and that thing crashes.

538
00:42:44,448 --> 00:42:45,519
Yeah, very true.

539
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:46,150
Very true.

540
00:42:46,150 --> 00:43:01,393
Yeah, I, you know, I, I think with, with this kind of shift left it like for those of us
who've been in the industry long enough, think embracing that is born out of.

541
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:08,129
one of two things, extreme trauma, where you're like, my God, I can't take this anymore.

542
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:14,332
And, and the other is just like pure curiosity, like, ooh, this looks really cool.

543
00:43:14,332 --> 00:43:16,289
And like having an open mind.

544
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:26,598
I honestly, I think the most successful techies are the ones who are open to change, open
to like what what the new tooling brings.

545
00:43:26,598 --> 00:43:31,340
And maybe maybe it's like, this thing doesn't do exactly what I want it to do.

546
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:31,620
And then

547
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,100
this is like where startups are born, right?

548
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:45,651
I mean, Kubernetes has got a whole ecosystem around it because of, guess it does stuff,
but like some stuff is kind of gnarly to do.

549
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:47,843
So let's make things easier.

550
00:43:47,843 --> 00:43:53,257
And I think that sort of thing drives innovation at the end of the day.

551
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,010
Are you happy where we're at?

552
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:02,790
Do you feel like that there's just one more thing, like get the observability done in
CI-CD pipelines and then everything will be great?

553
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:12,810
Or do you see like there's a concrete objective next step to get to the pinnacle of
perfection and observability?

554
00:44:13,194 --> 00:44:14,765
Ooh, that's a great question.

555
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:20,217
Actually, it's a topic for a talk that I'm giving next week at Observability Day in
London.

556
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:21,928
All right, I'm going to plug it.

557
00:44:21,928 --> 00:44:29,021
So basically the idea is, why does observability have to exist within the traditional
confines of tech?

558
00:44:29,122 --> 00:44:35,685
Why don't we bring observability and open telemetry to things like the recruitment
process?

559
00:44:35,685 --> 00:44:42,527
Like, you know, it's a yucky jobs market out there and the recruiting process has always
been painful.

560
00:44:42,568 --> 00:44:43,608
You never know.

561
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,633
you send out a resume, you don't know if you're gonna get a response.

562
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:51,476
And when you do, it might be a while.

563
00:44:51,476 --> 00:44:56,341
And then when you finally get that interview, it might be like a chunk of time between
interviews.

564
00:44:56,341 --> 00:45:05,429
Wouldn't it be nice if organizations put observability in their recruitment process, for
example, so that they have an understanding of like,

565
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:09,564
how long it takes in each stage of the interview process.

566
00:45:09,804 --> 00:45:16,047
Wouldn't it be cool to have a distributed trace that represents the end-to-end recruitment
process?

567
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:22,730
And we can take this to several other industries, like even the healthcare industry.

568
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:32,995
Look at hospital ER waiting times, understanding what if you apply open telemetry and
observability to

569
00:45:35,676 --> 00:45:42,981
ER is where you're like, okay, now you have an idea of like what the workflow is from
intake all the way to getting treatment.

570
00:45:42,981 --> 00:45:48,164
You have an idea of like the types of cases that get seen faster versus the ones that
don't.

571
00:45:48,365 --> 00:46:00,032
You can have a better understanding, have better data on racial profiling, for example,
wait times, the amount of time, you know, first to get seen, to get like imaging done, to

572
00:46:00,032 --> 00:46:01,654
get the results of the imaging.

573
00:46:01,654 --> 00:46:04,015
So I feel like the sky's the limit.

574
00:46:04,015 --> 00:46:05,476
And I think it's

575
00:46:05,476 --> 00:46:21,110
It's, I would say, easier, I'm going to say in air quotes, in larger organizations that
have access to monetary access to be able to purchase a subscription from a SaaS vendor or

576
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:25,834
run a homegrown solution for observability.

577
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:30,037
I think it can open up some really cool possibilities around that.

578
00:46:30,218 --> 00:46:33,491
See, I had a secret fear you were gonna say government oversight.

579
00:46:36,741 --> 00:46:39,218
Why would that be relevant at all?

580
00:46:39,218 --> 00:46:43,628
Yeah, so I know, I think you touched on something.

581
00:46:43,628 --> 00:46:48,396
Yeah, well, OK, yeah, so we won't go there.

582
00:46:49,682 --> 00:47:01,548
I do want to touch on something I think you added a nuance to, which is that the value
that could be captured here is actually directly related to the business and not arbitrary

583
00:47:01,548 --> 00:47:03,939
tech metrics about your running service.

584
00:47:03,939 --> 00:47:13,744
Like how many 200s and 300s you have or how long it's running, but maybe the value to the
actual customer and or the pain they're suffering through the user experience of your UI

585
00:47:13,744 --> 00:47:18,876
because you automatically coded it using one of these new vibe coding.

586
00:47:18,876 --> 00:47:20,756
auto creation UIs.

587
00:47:21,217 --> 00:47:25,188
And so, know, I think it's a really good point.

588
00:47:25,188 --> 00:47:30,949
And this can be applied to every industry, not just ones that are hard in tech, you know,
how are you collecting metrics today?

589
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:32,770
How are you actually evaluating these things?

590
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,400
Don't you want data?

591
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:41,662
And now I'm starting to wonder all of those smaller companies that are between zero and
let's say two or five employees.

592
00:47:42,546 --> 00:47:44,007
know, what are they doing?

593
00:47:44,207 --> 00:47:48,030
I know that like, maybe the last 30 years was all about digital transformation.

594
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:52,594
And I still know companies are hiring digital transformation consultants to make this
happen.

595
00:47:52,594 --> 00:47:58,658
And I think you've hit on like really the why which is you're missing the data, you're
like, you're not collecting it.

596
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:03,462
And this, this process, this standard is what's going to help you achieve that.

597
00:48:03,606 --> 00:48:03,976
Yeah.

598
00:48:03,976 --> 00:48:04,276
Yeah.

599
00:48:04,276 --> 00:48:07,088
And I mean, unfortunately, like we speak in data, right?

600
00:48:07,088 --> 00:48:12,860
Like, show me, show me the metrics and then tie the metrics to the money, right?

601
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,032
Cause corporations speak in dollars and cents.

602
00:48:17,733 --> 00:48:18,653
Yeah.

603
00:48:20,562 --> 00:48:25,303
You know, I do want to share this because I do think this list is quite ridiculous.

604
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:30,665
So you're a CNCF ambassador, you have a podcast, you're an author.

605
00:48:30,762 --> 00:48:37,326
I wrote a bunch of other things down here, but I see like, you know, conference speaker,
right?

606
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:44,619
What, is there still some milestone you're hoping to achieve next after this that you're
currently focused on?

607
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:46,179
You're like, no, I've done enough things.

608
00:48:46,179 --> 00:48:48,390
You know, I feel accomplished enough.

609
00:48:50,044 --> 00:48:53,496
well, I would love to like someday keynote at a KubeCon.

610
00:48:53,654 --> 00:48:59,439
I got my first keynote last year at KCD in Porto, Portugal.

611
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:02,560
And that was like, that was super exciting.

612
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,621
I'd never been asked a keynote.

613
00:49:04,621 --> 00:49:10,124
think I think the ultimate experience would be to keynote at a really large conference.

614
00:49:10,124 --> 00:49:11,624
That would be super fun.

615
00:49:12,005 --> 00:49:15,767
I did also find out this one's up there on the list.

616
00:49:15,767 --> 00:49:19,428
I found out last week that I'll be going to KubeCon Japan.

617
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:33,506
which is super exciting because it's the first ever KubeCon Japan and I've never been to
Japan and I'll be giving a talk on basically what we can do to make our observability

618
00:49:33,506 --> 00:49:35,929
greener and it's

619
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:47,678
It's a follow on, if you will, to a talk that I'm giving next week in London with my same
co-speaker, Nancy Chohan, where the talk next week is called How Green is My Open

620
00:49:47,678 --> 00:49:57,445
Telemetry Collector, and it talks about what you can do to start looking at optimizing
your hotel collector to make it more environmentally friendly.

621
00:49:57,534 --> 00:50:07,479
Do you feel lucky now that there is another piece of technology out there that is just so
much worse for the environment that no one's paying attention to?

622
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:10,000
Any sort of problem with storing extra data?

623
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,442
mean, storing the data, I mean, now that that's a trivial matter as far as impact goes.

624
00:50:15,565 --> 00:50:27,226
It's funny that like, you know, I, I almost feel, I feel guilty like working in this
industry, to be honest, because like, I've always like, since I was a kid, I was like,

625
00:50:27,226 --> 00:50:36,326
really into like environmental stuff and you know, like I, I bring a reusable cup to like
Starbucks or like, I love bubble tea.

626
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:39,466
So my local bubble tea place, I'll bring a reusable cup.

627
00:50:39,818 --> 00:50:49,863
And, you know, I've done the reasonable shopping bags for like 20 years, and yet I'm in an
industry that is inherently terrible for the environment.

628
00:50:49,863 --> 00:50:56,986
You know, data centers, I think contribute to like one or one to 2 % of, like the world's
greenhouse gas emissions.

629
00:50:57,166 --> 00:51:01,978
And then you add AI into the mix and it's like, ouch, observability.

630
00:51:01,978 --> 00:51:07,311
I mean, the fact that we're trying to understand our systems better through observability.

631
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:07,921
Well, guess what?

632
00:51:07,921 --> 00:51:09,652
You're emitting a crap ton

633
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:10,672
data.

634
00:51:10,953 --> 00:51:15,045
So your systems are expending more energy in doing so.

635
00:51:15,045 --> 00:51:25,120
And then your observability tooling and ingesting the data are also emitting a crap ton of
energy to do that.

636
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:33,494
So it's like we're adding to the problem, but then I also feel like technology can solve
the problem.

637
00:51:33,494 --> 00:51:37,046
Like those same AI agents that

638
00:51:37,632 --> 00:51:47,126
do expend a lot of energy can also help us further optimize our, you know, our, energy
usage to lessen our carbon footprint.

639
00:51:47,126 --> 00:51:50,066
think it's, there will be a balance.

640
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:56,279
Well, there's the paradox there and I don't remember the philosopher's name.

641
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,550
Hopefully someone else does.

642
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:07,414
If you increase the efficiency or you optimize it, you end up with more usage because it
becomes cheaper and more so in the end.

643
00:52:07,414 --> 00:52:13,167
that's not the unfortunately, it's not a path forward that I'm willing to I'm willing to
bet on.

644
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:19,640
But like I'm still bringing reusable, like paper bags to the grocery store for my bread
and vegetables.

645
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,000
Like

646
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,818
I am just as bad, you know, put it in a backpack and no plastic bags or anything.

647
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:32,137
And I've still got the same paper bag that my wife is like, why are you still reusing that
to carry stuff in?

648
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:38,271
I always forget mine, so I end up making it a trip out of the store with 37 things in my
arms.

649
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:41,700
Mmm backpack just you got to have a

650
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,543
the bag.

651
00:52:42,543 --> 00:52:43,947
It's ridiculous at this point.

652
00:52:43,947 --> 00:52:45,401
I have like a closet full of them.

653
00:52:45,401 --> 00:52:49,048
I'm like an episode of Hordes with just the reusable bags.

654
00:52:49,048 --> 00:52:54,714
donate them to some other people, or sell them right outside the store.

655
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:59,138
When Will comes out of the store and he's carrying lots of things, be like, hey, fuck.

656
00:53:00,808 --> 00:53:04,219
I don't know if that's legal, you know, not for resale.

657
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:05,700
Yeah, probably not.

658
00:53:08,203 --> 00:53:08,866
Damn it.

659
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:09,353
for that,

660
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:09,837
Could you?

661
00:53:09,837 --> 00:53:16,415
just have to be 50 feet away from the door and by that time I'm a very motivated customer
of your product anyway.

662
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,544
hahahaha

663
00:53:17,544 --> 00:53:25,717
you haven't gotten to your mode of transportation after 50 feet, mean, I worry what's
going on there.

664
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:29,193
I will ask maybe you can spoil it a little bit for us.

665
00:53:29,193 --> 00:53:33,256
What you mentioned data centers is not being that environmentally friendly.

666
00:53:33,256 --> 00:53:35,107
Is it is it the data storage?

667
00:53:35,107 --> 00:53:36,578
Is it the compute?

668
00:53:36,578 --> 00:53:38,119
Is it your memory usage?

669
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:40,671
Is it the main the hardware manufacturing that's doing it?

670
00:53:40,671 --> 00:53:48,546
So the building of new data center like do you know like which area is contributing or is
the most problematic for us?

671
00:53:48,853 --> 00:53:59,231
I don't know specifically, but I would gather like the power consumption alone of data
centers is huge and puts like a massive strain on power grids.

672
00:53:59,231 --> 00:54:09,543
So there's definitely, I would say, I would guess, now don't quote me on that, but I would
guess that that would definitely eat into things a fair bit.

673
00:54:09,543 --> 00:54:10,825
Yeah, and if it's the end.

674
00:54:10,825 --> 00:54:13,062
stuff I've heard, it's the cooling.

675
00:54:13,223 --> 00:54:23,074
Hmm, I could I could believe that yeah dealing with extra heat is a huge challenge But if
it's the energy then what we have to make sure realistically is that the energy we're

676
00:54:23,074 --> 00:54:24,815
creating is green

677
00:54:25,198 --> 00:54:27,457
just build more nuclear power plants.

678
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,712
Always the solution.

679
00:54:29,848 --> 00:54:30,729
It is.

680
00:54:32,073 --> 00:54:35,038
I can tell Warren wants to disagree.

681
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:36,024
Okay.

682
00:54:36,024 --> 00:54:37,705
no, absolutely agree 100%.

683
00:54:37,705 --> 00:54:45,708
There is no better form of energy, even though there's all these problems with, I say
nuclear, but we're saying fission, right?

684
00:54:45,729 --> 00:54:47,950
Because we're not at the fusion stage yet.

685
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:51,721
And there's just a lot of arguments where like, what do do with the wastewater?

686
00:54:51,721 --> 00:55:03,917
I'm like, compare that to the mining of the raw materials and the manufacturing of solar
panels or the actual damage to like migratory birds for flight paths for

687
00:55:03,957 --> 00:55:18,302
wind turbines and not to mention the non-renewable ones like you know it's just so absurd
to me sorry that's that's my own personal rant just cancel just cancel all non-commercial

688
00:55:18,302 --> 00:55:22,633
aircraft there should be no private jets you know that will solve a majority of the
world's

689
00:55:22,641 --> 00:55:23,823
so true.

690
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:24,883
Yeah.

691
00:55:28,078 --> 00:55:29,489
can't disagree.

692
00:55:30,012 --> 00:55:33,276
It's not going to impact my life, I'll tell you that for sure.

693
00:55:35,895 --> 00:55:39,239
Damn it, I'm going to cancel my Gulf Stream order now.

694
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,839
Hold on, BRB.

695
00:55:47,748 --> 00:55:56,848
but now that's like a few minutes ago you brought up a really interesting point about
using hotel metrics in other parts of the business and like immediately my mind exploded

696
00:55:56,848 --> 00:56:08,808
with like 10 different things in the company I work for right now, I'm like, holy shit,
like they totally need to see this.

697
00:56:09,448 --> 00:56:21,892
on a metrics dashboard and it's like, you mentioned recruiting process, but I'm thinking
like the sales pipeline or the implementation pipeline whenever we implement someone onto

698
00:56:21,892 --> 00:56:28,394
our product, the employee review process, what stage that's at.

699
00:56:28,394 --> 00:56:29,905
Like there's just so many different things.

700
00:56:29,905 --> 00:56:31,355
like, wow.

701
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,036
Even JIRA, like.

702
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:42,816
Where are things stalling at, moving tickets from new to done?

703
00:56:43,729 --> 00:56:45,700
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

704
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,901
like onboarding new employees.

705
00:56:47,901 --> 00:56:51,613
That's always such like such a pain no matter where you go.

706
00:56:51,613 --> 00:56:56,196
There is not a streamlined onboarding process, right?

707
00:56:56,196 --> 00:57:03,739
time to first commit, that's a big metric for me when I bring somebody on, like how long
before their first commit goes to production.

708
00:57:03,752 --> 00:57:04,605
Mm-hmm.

709
00:57:04,605 --> 00:57:05,398
that?

710
00:57:06,098 --> 00:57:07,742
manually at this point.

711
00:57:08,643 --> 00:57:19,466
Is it because there's just not a scale that you would need to make like you're not hiring
that many people like your turn rates, you know, low and so I guess that maybe the counter

712
00:57:19,466 --> 00:57:20,417
argument.

713
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:25,202
Why collect the data when the manual process is still sufficient?

714
00:57:25,474 --> 00:57:37,428
Yeah, for that specific example, time to first commit, you know, it would be hard to
justify automating it unless you already had everything in place and it was just building

715
00:57:37,428 --> 00:57:39,608
the dashboard that shows it.

716
00:57:40,508 --> 00:57:44,009
So that one hopefully is low value.

717
00:57:44,009 --> 00:57:53,152
Like if you're putting on that many new employees where you have to build a dashboard for
that, maybe you should be looking at metrics of like

718
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,224
What am I doing to piss my employees off and make them leave?

719
00:57:56,224 --> 00:57:59,245
Maybe that's a better metric for that scenario.

720
00:57:59,245 --> 00:58:06,939
I mean, I think you're onto something though, because if you're pushing the data towards
to them and they have to now consume technical dashboards, I think what we're saying is

721
00:58:06,939 --> 00:58:19,164
we're hoping that by doing this, we're changing the role from directly hands on to someone
that's more understanding of what like of a knowledge management process is in that area.

722
00:58:19,164 --> 00:58:21,826
you're talking about HR, but not so it's not HR anymore.

723
00:58:21,826 --> 00:58:26,028
It's a new kind of human resources where it's already being managed.

724
00:58:26,028 --> 00:58:29,239
Now it's about improving the process and that's a whole nother

725
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,312
above it.

726
00:58:31,896 --> 00:58:33,130
Yeah, we don't have HR now.

727
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:35,487
We have people business partners.

728
00:58:35,687 --> 00:58:36,537
Mmm.

729
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,265
Hahaha!

730
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:48,247
you laugh, but I do think that there is something, like all labels are wrong, some of them
are useful, and I think if you call it people, are more, two things happen.

731
00:58:48,247 --> 00:58:58,795
They do think about their leaders, like how to build leaders and whatnot, and then more
importantly about the careers of these people, rather than as fundamental resources, like

732
00:58:58,795 --> 00:59:04,258
your turn rate is important and whatnot, and I think that's something that's only happened
recently.

733
00:59:06,356 --> 00:59:10,199
see, I don't know about calling HR people, I mean, clearly they're people, right?

734
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:13,032
But like, they're not there for the employees.

735
00:59:14,734 --> 00:59:16,395
They're not robots yet.

736
00:59:16,395 --> 00:59:21,580
But like, they're not there for the employees, they're there to protect, like, the
company.

737
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:28,293
So this idea that they're looking out for you in your career is maybe, maybe we don't,
maybe I'm gonna disagree with that.

738
00:59:28,293 --> 00:59:30,164
Well, that's the point.

739
00:59:30,284 --> 00:59:39,558
if this organization is there to protect the company, why, of course, the company would
want to be making decisions based off of a metrics and a framework that is collecting

740
00:59:39,558 --> 00:59:43,250
actual data about the organization before making those decisions.

741
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:53,415
there was something, there was a research study done like 10 or 20 years ago that was a
consultant came in and had asked like all the executives of an organization to make a

742
00:59:53,415 --> 00:59:56,876
guess about how successful their sales will be over the next couple of quarters.

743
00:59:56,876 --> 00:59:58,237
And they were all

744
00:59:58,237 --> 01:00:04,572
like of course super confident about whatever it is that they were doing and just
absolutely wrong in a lot of ways.

745
01:00:04,572 --> 01:00:07,594
And I think you see the same thing over and over again across the fields.

746
01:00:07,594 --> 01:00:13,608
Like a majority of people think they're better than average, which is statistically not
possible.

747
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:22,555
And I think this is where having the additional data just goes to show you that you're
making more accurate decisions no matter what they are.

748
01:00:27,671 --> 01:00:28,467
story.

749
01:00:32,564 --> 01:00:38,771
Will just can't wait to get back to or get to work so he can start implementing these in
his least favorite department.

750
01:00:38,771 --> 01:00:39,627
You

751
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:40,159
I am.

752
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:41,643
O tell everything.

753
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,991
That's right, I tell everything.

754
01:00:45,796 --> 01:00:53,889
So speaking of which, how did you end up as part of the hotel SIG group?

755
01:00:54,977 --> 01:01:07,296
well, so first of all, I got into O-Tel because of my previous job at Lightstep, which was
my first job as a developer advocate.

756
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:12,619
So before that, I'd been doing a mix of like individual contributor work and management
work.

757
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:18,243
I decided at that point at my previous job that I'm done with management.

758
01:01:19,684 --> 01:01:20,835
Thanks, but no thanks.

759
01:01:20,835 --> 01:01:24,047
Had my, had a good run, but we done.

760
01:01:24,776 --> 01:01:34,574
And, but, so the job before Lightstep, when I was a manager, I'd been, I was managing two
teams, 13 people total.

761
01:01:35,015 --> 01:01:40,597
And I was managing a platform engineering team and an observability team.

762
01:01:40,918 --> 01:01:46,120
Platform engineering team was a HashiCorp stack and I knew Kubernetes and they were using
Nomad.

763
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,601
So it was like, great.

764
01:01:47,601 --> 01:01:53,003
Now I have to learn a thing that I don't know, which my brain was like, yay, fun stuff.

765
01:01:53,124 --> 01:01:59,146
And also this observability team, which I was new to observability.

766
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:00,647
I've been dabbling.

767
01:02:00,647 --> 01:02:05,289
Like my understanding of observability came from like reading charity majors.

768
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:06,570
tweets.

769
01:02:08,011 --> 01:02:14,856
And, you know, my thought was, well, I have to do right by my team, my organization.

770
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:24,782
And if I'm going to lead an observability team at the organization, and we were an
observability practices team, so defining the observability strategy at the company, two

771
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:33,728
cows, which is that two cows, if you remember the, yes, yes, but not doing that, it was
not the download of free Windows software anymore.

772
01:02:33,728 --> 01:02:34,830
They're domain hosts.

773
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:37,276
wholesaler when I joined.

774
01:02:40,275 --> 01:02:49,995
So as part of it, I'm like, the time I already had like this blog on Medium, where I'd
been, I've been using the blog to like basically learn in public, right?

775
01:02:49,995 --> 01:02:53,555
Document, document cool things that I've discovered and share them with the world.

776
01:02:53,555 --> 01:02:59,455
Cause I, my personal pet peeve is a lot of stuff is documented very poorly in tech.

777
01:02:59,455 --> 01:03:02,675
People assume that you know what they're talking about.

778
01:03:02,675 --> 01:03:09,795
And it makes me think of those math textbooks where they're like, we'll leave the, the,
uh, proof to the reader.

779
01:03:09,795 --> 01:03:10,229
And it's

780
01:03:10,229 --> 01:03:13,641
like, no, show me how the proof works because I have no frickin clue.

781
01:03:13,641 --> 01:03:18,314
This is, you know, how I feel with regards to most technical blogs.

782
01:03:18,314 --> 01:03:20,616
So, you know, mine are in excruciating detail.

783
01:03:20,616 --> 01:03:26,170
So I basically thought, well, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna learn Nomad in public.

784
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:31,443
I'm going to learn observability in public blog, blog, blog, as I'm, as I'm doing my job.

785
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:40,149
And then one of my blog posts got the attention of my former manager at Lightstep and they
reached out to me and said, Hey, how would you like to do this?

786
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:40,829
a living.

787
01:03:40,829 --> 01:03:41,949
like, what?

788
01:03:41,949 --> 01:03:43,889
You can do this for a living?

789
01:03:45,009 --> 01:03:52,549
And when I started on the job, they said, you know, it'd be cool to contribute to open
telemetry.

790
01:03:52,589 --> 01:04:02,889
And I had been in like, you know, super enterprise corporate life pretty much up until
that point where like closed source, all the things like the most open source stuff we did

791
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:04,869
was like Java and Maven.

792
01:04:05,149 --> 01:04:10,249
And everything else was like, there better be like, you know, a support

793
01:04:10,249 --> 01:04:19,275
plan for this open source software, otherwise we're not going to buy it, otherwise we're
not going to use it, which I understand like large enterprise, they got to cover their

794
01:04:19,275 --> 01:04:19,856
asses.

795
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,087
But so that was my first foray into open source.

796
01:04:22,087 --> 01:04:26,320
So I first started just contributing to the hotel docs.

797
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,562
And then there was an opening in the hotel end user SIG.

798
01:04:30,623 --> 01:04:35,256
And the end user SIG basically connects end users with each other in with an open
telemetry.

799
01:04:35,256 --> 01:04:40,049
But we also relay feedback from the end users to the open telemetry.

800
01:04:40,049 --> 01:04:41,630
maintainers.

801
01:04:42,371 --> 01:04:52,577
there was a gap in leadership because one of the original founders of the SIG had changed
jobs, moved away from open telemetry.

802
01:04:52,698 --> 01:05:00,413
my manager at the time asked if I wanted to step in and help out and that's how I got
involved.

803
01:05:00,413 --> 01:05:09,648
And at the time it was a working group and then it was converted into a SIG and we've done
a bunch of things to like just really

804
01:05:10,469 --> 01:05:14,932
Elevate the Othell community as part of the SIG.

805
01:05:14,932 --> 01:05:17,344
So we do a bunch of regular things.

806
01:05:17,344 --> 01:05:26,750
Like we have this series called Othell Me where we interview one of our end users and they
share how they use open telemetry in their own organizations.

807
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:39,528
We have Othell in practice, is basically, it's a meetup style thing where, you you have a
cool presentation on something Othell, like come on and present to us.

808
01:05:39,889 --> 01:05:42,971
You want to test out a talk that you want to give?

809
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:44,072
Use us as your guinea pig.

810
01:05:44,072 --> 01:05:51,676
And we do them as live streams, and then the recordings are available afterwards for folks
to consume on the Othell YouTube channel.

811
01:05:51,917 --> 01:05:58,381
We've partnered with the other SIGs to run end user surveys to understand.

812
01:05:58,381 --> 01:06:02,444
For example, the first one we did was on the Othell Collector.

813
01:06:02,544 --> 01:06:06,126
The Collector folks wanted to partner with us to understand how

814
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:12,822
how end users use the collector to help inform the direction of the collector.

815
01:06:12,822 --> 01:06:20,925
Like what features are most important to the user so that they can push forward with those
as part of the collector's roadmap.

816
01:06:21,005 --> 01:06:24,777
So that's effectively how I got involved with Othel.

817
01:06:24,777 --> 01:06:26,328
So most of my work is in the SIG.

818
01:06:26,328 --> 01:06:37,193
I I'll pop in every so often and update docs and readmes, especially like when I'm doing
research for my technical talks and I'm digging.

819
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:40,333
into a topic and I'll notice, there's a gap here.

820
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:41,616
I do two things.

821
01:06:41,616 --> 01:06:46,419
One is like, I'll write a blog post on it cause I love to do that.

822
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:50,322
But then the other thing is like, I want to be a good open source citizen.

823
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:53,334
And also like, I want the docs, i.e.

824
01:06:53,334 --> 01:06:58,387
the source of truth to have the information that I also make available in my blog.

825
01:06:58,387 --> 01:07:04,191
So, so that, you know, we have that completeness and I encourage everyone in open source
to do that as well.

826
01:07:04,191 --> 01:07:07,153
You know, like so many vendors have wonderful blogs.

827
01:07:07,153 --> 01:07:18,037
posts out there on observabil- like on on OpenTelemetry and I think it's great but if
you're noticing a gap in the docs like take take the time to to update update those docs

828
01:07:18,037 --> 01:07:28,530
update those readmes because it'll just save a lot of people a lot of a lot of effort
because the docs are the place where I think where most people start start their journey

829
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:34,322
and then they'll you know move to the blogs and the YouTube videos and whatnot for for
added information

830
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:37,988
Yeah, for sure.

831
01:07:37,988 --> 01:07:42,470
it's like writing docs is really hard.

832
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:49,913
So there's there's always room for improvement, especially for people who are just
starting their career.

833
01:07:49,913 --> 01:08:01,558
Like that's such a great way to just start getting getting some experience, you know,
because you read the docs, you tried it doesn't work.

834
01:08:01,638 --> 01:08:03,499
You go off you

835
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:13,306
and rant for a while and then you come back and then you try it again and eventually it
kind of like clicks and like making that that pull request back to the docs is a great way

836
01:08:13,306 --> 01:08:22,332
to start building a portfolio of expertise that will ultimately help you move on to bigger
and higher paying roles.

837
01:08:22,876 --> 01:08:23,521
big time

838
01:08:23,521 --> 01:08:32,292
I think writing is probably one of the best things you can do for your career or like
whatever the thing is that you do better with video or audio or like whatever, but just

839
01:08:32,292 --> 01:08:35,052
start to get your own voice and perspective out there.

840
01:08:35,052 --> 01:08:38,504
I don't think we should be discouraging people from entering the industry.

841
01:08:39,547 --> 01:08:40,900
Hehehehehe

842
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:41,816
people?

843
01:08:43,451 --> 01:08:45,086
by saying they have to write it.

844
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:52,474
I mean, I don't know about other people, but I became an engineer because I wanted to just
solve equations all the time.

845
01:08:52,474 --> 01:08:54,105
That was my goal.

846
01:08:54,105 --> 01:08:58,388
And now I don't do anything with numbers or math in any way.

847
01:08:58,388 --> 01:09:04,291
And I spent it all the time going to conferences and writing posts like Adriana.

848
01:09:04,631 --> 01:09:06,005
That's my life.

849
01:09:06,005 --> 01:09:06,325
Yeah.

850
01:09:06,325 --> 01:09:10,326
Well, communication is such a key part of being a good engineer.

851
01:09:10,326 --> 01:09:23,660
And I think it's, it's underplayed a lot, but, but when it comes to writing, I know a lot
of people with engineering oriented minds either aren't good writers or don't consider

852
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,570
themselves good writers.

853
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:29,111
And lately I've been using, AI.

854
01:09:29,111 --> 01:09:35,753
So I'll write something up and then copy paste it into AI and just have it just give me
some feedback on it.

855
01:09:35,753 --> 01:09:37,783
and I found that to be really helpful.

856
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,471
Yeah, I think it's a good starting point.

857
01:09:42,471 --> 01:09:56,211
My caution on that personally is I find AI, you know, it's like use with care, because AI
can take away your own personal writing voice.

858
01:09:57,112 --> 01:10:01,515
So that's just my personal take on it.

859
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:02,596
true story.

860
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:12,287
Yeah, I don't think you can have the AI just like straight up write stuff for you or it is
like very bland, like very, very, very bland.

861
01:10:12,287 --> 01:10:17,641
But I think you can use something like most of the grammar check tools all incorporate AI
now.

862
01:10:17,641 --> 01:10:24,027
So if you're using like Grammarly or ProWritingAid or something and you're worried about
punctuation or spelling, that would be me.

863
01:10:24,027 --> 01:10:26,469
That would be me worried about the punctuation and the spelling.

864
01:10:26,469 --> 01:10:34,203
It's not like, listen, it's just not going to happen if there's not some type of tool out
there or unless I hired an editor, which like not.

865
01:10:34,203 --> 01:10:40,195
gonna do for a blog post, like nobody's gonna do that, but I do think these, you know,
these tools do catch quite a bit of it.

866
01:10:40,868 --> 01:10:41,579
I agree.

867
01:10:41,579 --> 01:10:53,058
you know, like I'll, whenever I'm questioning, you know, the grammar on, something, I'll,
I'll throw that into AI to, you know, to verify either I'm heinously wrong or like, Hey, I

868
01:10:53,058 --> 01:10:53,708
got it right.

869
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:54,398
Yay.

870
01:10:54,505 --> 01:10:55,467
Right.

871
01:10:56,258 --> 01:10:58,616
Do you have a tool of choice for your work?

872
01:10:59,704 --> 01:11:04,877
for me, I'll use a Microsoft, co-pilot, every so often.

873
01:11:04,877 --> 01:11:09,989
So, like for my talks, for example, I have like talk mascots.

874
01:11:09,989 --> 01:11:15,271
So on, on my slides, I'll have like a theme, a theme animal.

875
01:11:15,511 --> 01:11:26,156
so for example, for my, one of my talks next week, the, the, green collector talk, we have
a polar bear wearing a green recycling t-shirt throughout.

876
01:11:26,577 --> 01:11:29,788
So co-pilot generates some, some fun.

877
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:41,766
some fun animations and you know sometimes I'll ask it to like I did ask it when I was
researching a talk to like write me some terraform code to do X which was helpful but then

878
01:11:41,766 --> 01:11:52,283
it hallucinated and generated me a actually was in terraform was Pulumi it generated me a
Pulumi function that didn't exist and that kind of pissed me off for an hour I'm like

879
01:11:52,283 --> 01:11:59,278
where is this bloody function did not exist but yeah yeah that's that's that's the main
one

880
01:11:59,278 --> 01:12:00,441
that I use.

881
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:02,445
My dad swears by perplexity.

882
01:12:02,445 --> 01:12:03,949
He says it's quite good.

883
01:12:03,949 --> 01:12:07,194
I've never tried it, but he swears by it.

884
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:12,133
At least you've got one of your parents using a modern tool.

885
01:12:12,133 --> 01:12:12,808
That's a.

886
01:12:12,808 --> 01:12:18,748
my God, my dad is a retired software architect and he like learned Rust for fun two years
ago.

887
01:12:18,748 --> 01:12:30,228
He's 72 and he's like, yes, I'm writing my own Rust crates to do like some performance
testing on some code that I wrote and I'm using statistical analysis methods, blah, blah,

888
01:12:30,228 --> 01:12:30,308
blah.

889
01:12:30,308 --> 01:12:31,488
I'm like,

890
01:12:31,568 --> 01:12:36,268
Dude, I learned this stuff in university and I don't remember a single bit of it.

891
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:40,468
And he's like, you know, refreshing his knowledge on this stuff.

892
01:12:40,468 --> 01:12:42,968
I'm like, you do you.

893
01:12:47,105 --> 01:12:47,745
All right, on.

894
01:12:47,745 --> 01:12:49,745
Well, this feels like a good time to move over to Pix.

895
01:12:49,745 --> 01:12:50,628
What do you think?

896
01:12:50,628 --> 01:12:52,128
Yes, let's do it.

897
01:12:52,128 --> 01:12:53,660
Warren, over to you.

898
01:12:53,783 --> 01:12:55,847
Well, I knew it was going to be me first.

899
01:12:55,847 --> 01:12:59,333
So I was actually surprised that you weren't just going to immediately go to me.

900
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,294
So.

901
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,232
Yeah, well, it's OK.

902
01:13:04,232 --> 01:13:07,365
I'm always prepared, so it works out.

903
01:13:08,267 --> 01:13:18,254
So today I'm going to be super lame, but we're gonna have a survey that's gonna be posted
on adventure in DevOps.com slash survey.

904
01:13:18,755 --> 01:13:26,121
because I have them, I'm going to give away five awards of AWS credits based on the
responses.

905
01:13:26,121 --> 01:13:27,152
I don't know how many give them out yet.

906
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:28,623
We're gonna see based on the responses.

907
01:13:28,623 --> 01:13:32,326
And I'm not sure what the questions are yet, but the survey is gonna be there.

908
01:13:32,326 --> 01:13:33,857
I assure everyone.

909
01:13:34,496 --> 01:13:34,816
Right on.

910
01:13:34,816 --> 01:13:35,476
That'll be cool.

911
01:13:35,476 --> 01:13:39,438
I'm looking forward to hearing from folks on that.

912
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:47,291
And I mean, you're getting AWS credits for it, so it's going to be a little incentive to
go into it even.

913
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:48,982
Yeah.

914
01:13:49,876 --> 01:13:50,743
All right.

915
01:13:52,063 --> 01:13:52,744
Right?

916
01:13:52,744 --> 01:13:53,824
For sure.

917
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,628
Adriana, us a pic today.

918
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:04,070
a thing that I really like it's an activity.

919
01:14:04,491 --> 01:14:08,435
I'm a rock climber so I love bouldering.

920
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:18,297
I think, you know, if, if, if you have kids that like to scramble up things, highly
recommend taking your kids bouldering.

921
01:14:18,297 --> 01:14:20,698
and also as an adult, try it out.

922
01:14:21,138 --> 01:14:22,359
that is my pick for you.

923
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:32,103
And as a, as a personal thing, every, every city that I visit, you know, when, when,
whether it's on vacation or, or at a conference, I always make it a point of checking out

924
01:14:32,103 --> 01:14:34,204
the local bouldering gym.

925
01:14:34,314 --> 01:14:39,286
bouldering is a little bit scary for those who aren't familiar with rock climbing, cause
there's like the rope climbing.

926
01:14:40,327 --> 01:14:51,274
And then there's bouldering, is like you're up, I want to say like 10 feet up, no rope,
big fluffy mat at the bottom.

927
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:53,536
You can still get injured.

928
01:14:54,097 --> 01:15:02,182
I sprained my ankle twice, the same ankle from just a bad fall, but it is great fun.

929
01:15:02,182 --> 01:15:09,737
Especially if you're looking to just like step outside of, know, whatever it is that you
do as your day job.

930
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:21,511
great way to just decompress because you've got nothing better to do, but, you know, focus
on getting to the next move and going up the wall and you can't, your mind can't flinch,

931
01:15:21,511 --> 01:15:24,612
can't get distracted because otherwise you fall.

932
01:15:25,452 --> 01:15:27,773
So it's very therapeutic.

933
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:32,463
Jillian, are you back with us?

934
01:15:32,463 --> 01:15:33,283
Okay.

935
01:15:33,543 --> 01:15:37,563
So I'm gonna pick the newest Expeditionary Force book.

936
01:15:37,563 --> 01:15:46,523
It's a science fiction series that's like, unlike most science fiction, it's kind of campy
and it kind of like goofy and silly and doesn't have a lot of horror or gore or things

937
01:15:46,523 --> 01:15:54,943
that I don't like reading, which is very hard to find in science fiction, I found, because
a lot of them have just stuff that I don't want to read about.

938
01:15:55,255 --> 01:15:58,053
So that's it, Expeditionary Force by Craig Allenson.

939
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:00,830
It's probably one of my favorite science fiction series.

940
01:16:01,563 --> 01:16:02,453
Right on.

941
01:16:03,434 --> 01:16:04,015
Cool.

942
01:16:04,015 --> 01:16:07,056
I'm to go with two picks this week.

943
01:16:07,537 --> 01:16:09,878
One, there's a guy.

944
01:16:09,999 --> 01:16:10,686
He's a kid.

945
01:16:10,686 --> 01:16:11,160
Let's be honest.

946
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,240
He's a kid.

947
01:16:12,721 --> 01:16:14,762
I think he's probably mid 20s.

948
01:16:14,762 --> 01:16:19,105
His name is Dan Coe and he's really fascinating.

949
01:16:19,386 --> 01:16:30,283
Just his take and like the amount of work and effort he's put into studying like
philosophy and like

950
01:16:30,521 --> 01:16:36,263
the meaning of life and your purpose and your calling like really extraordinary stuff for
someone who's so young.

951
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:44,345
He just released a new book yesterday called Purpose Prophet 2 that he's giving it away
for free on his website.

952
01:16:44,705 --> 01:16:56,529
The Danco.com Dancoe and so I'm just starting to started reading it but he's written so
much other great stuff following him on X his stuff there has been so cool.

953
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:57,609
I'm just going to

954
01:16:57,755 --> 01:17:01,248
go right ahead and recommend his book before I've even finished reading it.

955
01:17:01,248 --> 01:17:07,894
I just feel like the quality is gonna be there for anyone who's interested in reading
that.

956
01:17:07,894 --> 01:17:17,482
And then the second pick I have, so there's a really like humiliating story I'll go with
first to set the stage for this.

957
01:17:17,503 --> 01:17:19,964
Like I spent my youth,

958
01:17:22,117 --> 01:17:29,102
going to a lot of heavy metal concerts and playing guitar in heavy metal bands.

959
01:17:29,143 --> 01:17:35,028
And so it turns out that because of all the headbanging involved, you can actually get
whiplash.

960
01:17:35,028 --> 01:17:43,094
And so I have like the long-term effects of whiplash from my taste in music.

961
01:17:44,175 --> 01:17:51,708
And it's, I've had lots of, had some different problems with it over the years, but
recently I got this thing called an iron neck.

962
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:53,980
to like strengthen my neck muscles.

963
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:55,281
And so that's my second pick.

964
01:17:55,281 --> 01:18:00,174
It's like this really super cool looking head gadget that you put on your head.

965
01:18:00,174 --> 01:18:03,847
Definitely wanna do it.

966
01:18:03,847 --> 01:18:04,467
Right?

967
01:18:04,467 --> 01:18:06,127
Yeah, right.

968
01:18:06,127 --> 01:18:06,864
You all right.

969
01:18:06,864 --> 01:18:10,175
a total fashion statement, absolute fashion statement.

970
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:23,509
if you're just looking to like, like if you want to like either improve your neck muscles
or just improve like your social credibility in life, you want to go strutting around town

971
01:18:23,509 --> 01:18:25,429
with the iron neck on.

972
01:18:25,609 --> 01:18:27,260
But yeah, right.

973
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,626
Deal, deal.

974
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:32,204
to wear it the whole next episode.

975
01:18:32,204 --> 01:18:34,289
I think it's just gonna have to be on.

976
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:37,224
The next fashion statement.

977
01:18:37,224 --> 01:18:38,204
Right?

978
01:18:38,845 --> 01:18:40,345
So yeah, those are my two picks.

979
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:44,486
Dan Coe's new book at thedancoe.com and Iron Neck.

980
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:54,119
And like the reason I bring up the Iron Neck is even if you don't have whiplash from
spinning your youth, headbanging, sitting at a desk all day long hunched over your

981
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:59,090
keyboard also has negative impact on your posture and your neck strength.

982
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:06,772
So this is a way to help counteract that so that whenever you do make it to old age that
you still have the ability to

983
01:19:06,814 --> 01:19:10,165
you know, stand upright or even perhaps look at the sky.

984
01:19:10,165 --> 01:19:12,564
I think I'm gonna need to do some research on that.

985
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:13,860
Alright, on.

986
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:22,870
I don't know, I think it's a pretty bold claim to be like, all gonna make it to old age, I
don't know about that, but I guess one can hope.

987
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:28,350
I want like a standing ovation from the universe if I make it past 60, like that's what I
want.

988
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:33,982
So there's a podcast that I've been listening to called Wiser Than Me.

989
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:48,769
It's with Seinfeld actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, where she basically interviews all these
like older ladies, you know, high profile older ladies like Jane Fonda, Amy Tan.

990
01:19:49,429 --> 01:19:53,691
And it's been, it was recommended to me by actually one of my podcast guests.

991
01:19:53,856 --> 01:19:55,805
It is great fun.

992
01:19:56,099 --> 01:19:57,183
Right on.

993
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,584
Cool.

994
01:19:57,584 --> 01:20:00,242
And then there's your podcast as well, right?

995
01:20:00,242 --> 01:20:02,196
The geeking out podcast.

996
01:20:03,282 --> 01:20:03,744
Yeah.

997
01:20:03,744 --> 01:20:14,479
up geeking out with Adriana Villela, because otherwise if you just look up geeking out,
it's going to like give you like so many different listings on the various podcasting

998
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:14,729
apps.

999
01:20:14,729 --> 01:20:20,482
So geeking out with Adriana Villela, do that search term, you should be able to find the
correct one.

1000
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:24,594
And there's a capivada on the on the cover art.

1001
01:20:24,594 --> 01:20:25,404
So.

1002
01:20:25,463 --> 01:20:26,344
Nice.

1003
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:28,551
Awesome.

1004
01:20:28,551 --> 01:20:30,697
Adriana, thank you so much for being on the show.

1005
