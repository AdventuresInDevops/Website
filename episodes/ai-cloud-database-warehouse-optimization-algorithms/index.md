We discuss the challenges of AI adoption in cloud computing, addressing concerns like implementation risks, security, and trust in autonomous agents. Barzan explains how machine learning models can optimize performance, reduce cloud costs, and automate database management, freeing engineers from tedious manual tuning.

Additionally, we explore the future of AI in database systems, the evolving landscape of public and private datasets, and what the next decade holds for data-driven automation. Whether you're a DevOps engineer or a database architect, this episode is packed with insights into the intersection of AI and cloud technology.
