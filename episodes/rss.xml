Yasmin Rajabi, Chief Strategy Officer at CloudBolt, joins us to demystify, as we acknowledge the critical challenge of bringing together financial accountability and engineering teams who often are not paying attention to the business.<br /><br />The discussion further explores the practicalities of FinOps in the context of cloud spending and Kubernetes. Yasmin highlights that a significant amount of waste in organizations comes from simply not turning off unused systems and not right-sizing resources. She explains how tools like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) can help, but also points out the complexities of optimizing across horizontal and vertical scaling behaviors. The conversation touches on "shame back reporting" as a way to provide visibility into costs for engineering teams, although the conversation emphasizes that providing tooling and insights is more effective than simply telling developers to change configurations.<br /><br />The episode also delves into the evolving mindset around cloud costs, especially with the rise of AI and machine learning workloads. While historically engineering salaries eclipsed cloud spending, the increasing hardware requirements for ML and data workloads are making cost optimization a more pressing concern. Spending-conscious teams are increasingly asking about GPU optimization, even if AI/ML teams are still largely focused on limitless spending to drive unjustified "innovation".

We're joined by Brian Pontarelli, founder of FusionAuth and CleanSpeak. Warren and Brian face off by diving into the controversial topic of multitenant versus single-tenant architecture. Expert co-host Aimee Knight joins to moderate the discussion. Ever wondered how someone becomes an "auth expert"? Warren spills the beans on his journey, explaining it's less about a direct path and more about figuring out what it means for yourself. Brian chimes in with his own "random chance" story, revealing how they fell into it after their forum-based product didn't pan out.<br /><br />Aimee confesses her "alarm bells" start ringing whenever multitenant architecture is mentioned, jokingly demanding "details" and admitting her preference for more separation when it comes to reliability. Brian makes a compelling case for his company's chosen path, explaining how their high-performance, downloadable single-tenant profanity filter, CleanSpeak, handles billions of chat messages a month with extreme low latency. This architectural choice became a competitive advantage, attracting companies that couldn't use cloud-based multitenant competitors due to their need to run solutions in their own data centers.<br /><br />We critique cloud providers' tendency to push users towards their most profitable services, citing AWS Cognito as an example of a cost-effective solution for small-scale use that becomes cost-prohibitive with scaling and feature enablement. The challenges of integrating with Cognito, including its reliance on numerous other AWS services and the need for custom Lambda functions for configuration, are also a point of contention. The conversation extends to the frustrations of managing upgrades and breaking changes in both multitenant and single-tenant systems and the inherent difficulties of ensuring compatibility across different software versions and integrations. The episode concludes with a humorous take on the current state and perceived limitations of AI in software development, particularly concerning security.<br /><br /><b>Picks</b><br /><ul><li>Warren - <a href="https://world.scarpa.com/product/26407274/mojito-lifestyle-sneakers-for-leisure-sports-travel-thyme-green" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scarpa Hiking shoes - Planet Mojito Suade</a></li><li>Aimee - <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/tread" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peloton Tread</a></li><li>Brian - <a href="https://www.searchcraft.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Searchcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13652286/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fight or Flight</a></li></ul>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://api.spreaker.com/episode/67018160</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 19:22:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/api.spreaker.com/download/episode/67018160/brian_pontarelli.mp3" length="51248945" type="audio/mpeg"/><podcast:transcript url="https://transcription.spreaker.com/starship/b1c62af2-2d52-4794-9080-6c11f7c3f9d0/b1c62af2-2d52-4794-9080-6c11f7c3f9d0.srt" type="application/x-subrip" language="en"/><podcast:transcript url="https://transcription.spreaker.com/starship/b1c62af2-2d52-4794-9080-6c11f7c3f9d0/b1c62af2-2d52-4794-9080-6c11f7c3f9d0.txt" type="text/plain" language="en"/><podcast:transcript url="https://transcription.spreaker.com/starship/b1c62af2-2d52-4794-9080-6c11f7c3f9d0/b1c62af2-2d52-4794-9080-6c11f7c3f9d0.vtt" type="text/vtt" language="en"/><itunes:author>Will Button, Warren Parad</itunes:author><itunes:summary><![CDATA[Get ready for a lively debate on this episode of Adventures in DevOps.

Omer Hamerman joins Will and Warren to take a hard look at it. Despite the rise of serverless solutions promising to abstract away infrastructure management, Omer shares that Kubernetes has seen a surge in adoption, with potentially 70-75% of corporations now using or migrating to it.

Is the average tenure in tech decreasing, we discuss it and do a deep dive on the consequences in the SRE world.<br /><br />Picks<a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/sre-insights-from-the-streaming-world/#picks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">​</a><br /><ul><li><a href="https://adventuresindevops.com/survey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Adventures In DevOps: Survey</a></li><li><a href="http://dev.to/wparad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warren's Technical Blog</a></li><li>Warren: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Discipline-Fieldbook-Strategies-Themes/dp/0787964503" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Fifth Discipline by Peter Senge</a></li><li>Aimee: Sleep Token (Band) - <a href="https://youtu.be/4iSvoQNfrrk?si=7Fz9BbJ3AM0gnw7j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Caramel</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/om4dEGKnEmw?si=zi87FTA2RsYc8Xif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Granite</a></li><li>Will: <a href="https://www.netflix.com/ch-en/title/81701547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bear Grylls Celebrity Hunt on Netflix</a></li><li>Jillian: <a href="https://www.horizon.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Video Game</a></li></ul>]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>4675</itunes:duration><itunes:keywords>architecture,automation,career,devops,engineering,leadership,llms,product,reliability,software,sre,technology</itunes:keywords><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d3wo5wojvuv7l.cloudfront.net/t_rss_itunes_square_1400/images.spreaker.com/original/2f474744f84e93eba827bee58d58c1c9.jpg"/><itunes:episode>246</itunes:episode><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>Exploring MCP Servers and Agent Interactions with Gil Feig</title><link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes/mcp-servers-and-agent-interactions/</link><description><![CDATA[In this episode, we delve into the concept of MCP (Machine Control Protocol) servers and their role in enabling agent interactions.

From his wild career transition out of financial services into 24/7 node ops for Web3, Paul shares the brutal truth about uptime expectations, decentralization challenges, and why hard forks are more like enterprise schema upgrades with a community twist. If you’ve ever wondered why managing a blockchain node is like owning a temperamental pet server, this one’s for you.<br /><br />The team goes deep on the nitty-gritty of load balancing across dozens of chains, explaining why routing traffic to the “wrong” archive node could ruin your day—and how Ankr’s custom load balancer is basically magic for JSON-RPC calls. Warren tosses out wild scenarios about encrypted data smuggling via blockchain, while Will confesses his angry typing habit (yes, it’s back). The discussion gets even more fun with debates on innovation vs. rigor, Web2's forgotten best practices, and why testing in prod might not be such a dirty word after all.<br /><br />But don’t think it’s all crypto and code.

From his wild career transition out of financial services into 24/7 node ops for Web3, Paul shares the brutal truth about uptime expectations, decentralization challenges, and why hard forks are more like enterprise schema upgrades with a community twist. If you’ve ever wondered why managing a blockchain node is like owning a temperamental pet server, this one’s for you.<br /><br />The team goes deep on the nitty-gritty of load balancing across dozens of chains, explaining why routing traffic to the “wrong” archive node could ruin your day—and how Ankr’s custom load balancer is basically magic for JSON-RPC calls. Warren tosses out wild scenarios about encrypted data smuggling via blockchain, while Will confesses his angry typing habit (yes, it’s back). The discussion gets even more fun with debates on innovation vs. rigor, Web2's forgotten best practices, and why testing in prod might not be such a dirty word after all.<br /><br />But don’t think it’s all crypto and code. Paul shares battle-won wisdom from running over 100 chains across bare metal, giving us a peek at the operational sophistication and automation involved. From Terraform templates to Docker configs, he walks through the process of onboarding new chains and tuning for performance.

Whether that's something simple like a raise or something more complex like going freelance, you can achieve it by working on 3 main areas.First, building skills. The most obvious type of skills you'll need is technical skills. However, don't neglect your people skills and your organizational skills as well since you're often paid for how you work with people and enhance their work and how you put your work together in the most efficient ways.Second, building relationships. Often other people will be able to help you find the opportunities or will be the ones to make the decisions that impact your ability to get the outcome you want. Having good relationships is key to having good outcomes.Third, building recognition. Being known for being valuable in important ways allows you to leverage the skills you have to build better relationships and create opportunities to get what you need to get the outcomes you want by giving people what they want. A podcast is a great way to do all three.

The organization grew but the DevOps team didn’t scale with it, leaving them with piles of tickets and everyone else wondering what was taking so long. The panel commiserates with Adam and shares some of their own similar stories. Reaching out to others to help solve the problem, Adam found that many DevOps teams had and are experiencing the same problem. He found help from others in the DevOps space and recommended books. His team started by making their work more visible. To do this they streamlined their communication and published documentation. Next, they made more focused goals. Instead of trying to do everything and never meeting their goals they chose a couple things to work on and focused on that. Another change they made was to diversify their meetings, projects, and initiatives; they brought in people from all the teams to collaborate, making the projects even better. The panel discusses the importance of empathy in the workplace and in life. Most people are trying their best and probably have a reason for doing the things that they are doing.

John is a developer and has worked in DevOps for his whole career spanning about 12 years. He is also the author of Shiplane. John made Shiplane after working with Docker for a while and getting fed up with some features not being as he wanted them to be. The panelists begin the discussion with going over John’s talk “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”, where he covers three camps of developers namely pioneers, settlers, and townsfolk and the panelists go into detail about these camps. They also talk about how docker and Shiplane fit into this idea. John shares that Shiplane is a tool that converts docker-compose yaml files into production-ready docker deployments. John details more of how shiplane came about, the problems it solves, how it works, and how it helps users to cross knowledge barriers. He also shares how Shiplane provides customizability as it will give the user everything they need but lets them choose the pieces they want. The panelists also discuss what websites are running Shiplane as well as some of the support that Shiplane has. Currently it does not support Kubernetes but John is working on it. Chuck then asks John what the use case is for running Shiplane. They discuss specifically whether Shiplane is used locally, or as a SAAS service and why it is the way it is. Nell then asks John what his hopes are for the future of Shiplane. John would like to have Kubernetes capability added within a year. If someone wants to get involved with Shiplane they can do so by trying it out, reaching out to him on his discord server, and helping him find edge cases.  Panelists<ul><li>Nell Shamrell-Harrington</li><li>Scott Nixon</li><li>Charles Max Wood</li></ul>Guest<ul><li>John Epperson </li></ul>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">fbdd0ecd-e039-4550-9035-841ecbf88b06</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2019 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/api.spreaker.com/download/episode/58847454/stream.mp3" length="52782048" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Will Button, Warren Parad</itunes:author><itunes:summary><![CDATA[This episode of Adventures in DevOps is joined by John Epperson.

He currently works at Hover and is helping them move towards continuous delivery. Nell opens up the discussion by asking Julian to explain what continuous integration and continuous delivery are. He shares that continuous integration revolves around having testing and automation around the code being pushed to ensure that it works and conforms to standards. Continuous delivery feeds off of the concept of continuous integration and is the ability to deploy to any environment at any point in time. Chuck puts these ideas together by saying that continuous delivery and continuous deployment is about making sure that it’s possible to deploy at any time and actually doing so. The next topic covered by the Adventures in DevOps panelists is how to handle apprehension around having a continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Julian shares that big cultural changes are required to make CI/CD successful. They share that a lot of organizations are nervous about code with breaking changes immediately being deployed. One way to handle this vulnerability is by hiding features behind feature flags so that only certain people, for example the QA team, will have access to the feature.They share why an organization would want to change to a continuous delivery pipeline and some real world examples that they have experiencedChuck asks what some prerequisites are for a CI/CD pipeline. Scott says that one thing that needs to happen is backfilling areas of the application that previously did not have tests and expanding the testing coverage of the system. Julian shares that these prerequisites depend on how changes are made and shares some specific examples of what that entails. Nell asks what it takes for an organization to be able to do continuous delivery. Julian shares that it is mostly process driven. They establish some rules such as shortening the lifetime of development branches and improving how they are deployed. They also have a discussion on how integration tests should come about and who should write them. Julian mentions that you want to empower people and give them the tools they need to succeed. They then cover some of the work that Julian has done with Hover and some of the details of the continuous delivery environment he is building and the steps they took to begin moving towards that workflow.The topic then moves to dependency management. Nell asks Julian how he approached dependencies in his applications. Julian details how his usage of containers and specific tools helped him. For external environments he says that a database is required and that it would help to have standards for managing dependencies. They share how the current development culture is to give the QA team enough time to test a feature before it goes out. With a CI/CD environment, feature flags can be used to gradually roll out a changes and if a certain users needs a specific set of features then an individual environment can be spun up for their use case. The panelists share some thoughts on environments setup and production best practices and tooling. Panelists<ul><li>Nell Shamrell-Harrington</li><li>Charles Max Wood</li><li>Scott Nixon</li></ul> Guest<ul><li>Julian Fahrer</li></ul>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">12e5efe4-bdda-47b4-8698-8cb46fbbf906</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2019 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/api.spreaker.com/download/episode/58847418/stream.mp3" length="63085864" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Will Button, Warren Parad</itunes:author><itunes:summary><![CDATA[Julian Fahrer is a software engineer with a systems administration and operations background.

Dave has an extensive background in open source starting in 1994 working with early versions of Linux. He thrives on the concepts of emerging technologies and being able to innovate things. He also loves understanding what people are doing with emerging technology. The discussion opens up by introducing the topic of multi-dimensional monitoring in RED. Dave gives us an introduction into RED as a subset of google’s SRE Golden signals. RED stands for rate, errors, and durations and is a concept that is designed for working with micro services. The DevOps panelists discuss concepts such as saturation and how to ensure correct results from their micro services using the RED concepts as well as some best practices for managing micro services.  Nell asks about the scope of RED and whether it works with the big picture of what the micro service is doing. Dave shares that the scope of RED pertains to both. RED helps with observability and how to get the right signals out of all the noise and how to respond once the correct signals are found. He shares that RED should be a set of metrics in a dashboard that can be aggregated. He explains that RED gives the user a way of grouping data together and helping them to normalize functionality and find trends. The next topic covered by the DevOps experts is how to map the metrics seen in RED to the user experience. Dave explains how RED monitors the users activity and can put together metrics based on what they’re doing. Using RED to follow user metrics will help to identify trends in where users will have issues and identify problem areas. Using micro services with RED introduces a level of granularity that can be monitored to help improve the performance of the application and improve scaling. RED helps with these improvements most notably by improving reaction time once a problem is found to help correct it as soon as possible. The panelists discuss some real world examples and how real world activities and human tendencies can alter patterns seen in the monitoring. Dave points out that one of the strongest recommendations he can make about RED is its ability to start simple and scale upwards as needed. The panelists then go on to discuss the human aspect of RED, how a team would react to changing, and how RED really requires a true DevOps team to reach its full potential. The panelists then share experiences they faced earlier in their careers as developers and how RED could have helped them. Nell brings up the idea of service meshes and how RED applies to them. Dave starts by introducing some problems in micro services and service meshes and the opportunity that exists for RED to come in and help solve those problems. He explains how service meshes in micro services give you duration that you don’t have to implement. They finish with covering the usage of Kubernetes operators. Panelists<ul><li>Nell Shamrell-Harrington</li></ul> Guest<ul><li>Dave McAllister </li></ul>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">b79c088d-a497-40ce-b88d-cd2d662ecdd8</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2019 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/api.spreaker.com/download/episode/58847442/stream.mp3" length="39900076" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Will Button, Warren Parad</itunes:author><itunes:summary><![CDATA[This episode of Adventures in Devops features Dave McAllister.

Charles mentions that he is wanting to host a Ruby on Rails application and Scott has experience with web deployments in Python and Django. They share that regardless of the languages and technologies used, the principles behind deploying a containerized application are the same.The next topic covered by the DevOps panelists is how to create containerized instances using Docker. The discussion centers on creating the container instances on a network and best practices that can be used for managing and maintaining them. The DevOps panelists cover the difference between an internal network deployment and what is needed to push a containerized application to a cloud instance using Kubernetes, Docker, DigitalOcean, or another service. Scott asks Charles if he is using a good CI/CD (continuous integration/ continuous delivery) mechanism, to which Charles shares that he is using Cloud 66 for its ease of use. When it comes to storage, they discuss whether to use the cloud services storage option or using a container to run a Postgres engine. They also go over the best way to run the shell commands for configuring their environment.The topic then moves to security and asset management when using Docker. Charles mentions that he tries to avoid putting API keys or other secrets into the Docker file and Scott shares how he uses a secrets management platform such as AWS Parameter Store, AWS Secrets Management, and others. They discuss the benefits that are provided by secrets management platforms. The DevOps panelists also talked about how a CI/CD platform can help with the portability of a containerized applicationCharles asks Scott how to begin with helping someone who wants to take their existing application and containerize it using the Docker approach. Scott responds with describing how he would look at where there application is and help them configure their containerized instance and set it up on a container service such as Docker or Kubernetes. Scott mentions that the strength of moving an application to a container service helps the application to scale up and down as needed. The container model helps a team to locally replicate their CI/CD model and be able to test it locally before the application is pushed to the cloud instance.The panelists talk about reverse proxies for pushing a Ruby on Rails app. Chuck prefers nginx and Scott emphasizes that it is important when pushing to production to spend some time verifying that the reverse proxy configuration is correct and won’t expose the application in a way that it shouldn’t be. Chuck shares that the use of a cloud platform such as GCP (Google Cloud Platform) of Microsoft Azure reduces the overhead with configuring containers and building images so that when he hands it off to the platform, it will take care of a large part of the setup including creation of the reverse proxy. Panelists<ul><li>Charles Max Wood</li><li>Scott Nixon</li></ul>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">3df760fa-6746-47af-8b65-05823b580202</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2019 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/api.spreaker.com/download/episode/58847402/stream.mp3" length="49294931" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Will Button, Warren Parad</itunes:author><itunes:summary><![CDATA[On this episode of Adventures in DevOps the panelists talk about how to containerize an app in a container using services such as Docker or Kubernetes.

Nell starts the discussion by mentioning that Agile came out of the Scrum movement and gives a brief history of how it started. She reads out the Agile Manifesto, and Scott explains what it is. They agree that “move faster slowly” can be considered as a motto of Agile. Scott talks about the testing aspect of it from a philosophical perspective, and Nell chimes in with comparison to how things were being done in the past versus now.They discuss the 12 principles behind the Agile manifesto. One - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Two - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage, basically valuing learning and improvements. Three - deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months with a preference for a shorter time scale, the focus being on the code being in a working state. Four - Business people and developers should collaborate daily through the project. Scott elaborates on the point further, and shares his experience where it was challenging to work with the business side of the project.Five - Build projects around motivated individuals, give them the support they need and trust them to get the job done, trust being the most important factor here. Six - The most efficient method of conveying information is having a face-to-face conversation, here the panelists provide a counter-argument that in the era of online platforms and remote work, this is not necessarily essential. Seven - Working software is the primary measure of progress. Eight - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. ‘Sustainable’ is key here, avoiding overworking and burnout is important anyday. Nine - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. This means doing the full set of code reviews and tests and still deploy software quickly and making sure that it doesn’t break things, if it does, it has to be rolled back.Ten - Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential. This highlights the need for focus in the product, and not writing a lot of code that could eventually be unusable. Eleven - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. Panelists talk about people involved in open source projects as an example of such self-organizing teams, where they work on their own schedule and have great interest in what they are building. Twelve - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. Retrospectives, reflecting where you are, how the team works together and documenting results as some sort of a learning exercise, are some of the practical examples of this.Nell then talks about the three layers of Agile infrastructure by Patrick Debois - considered as the father of DevOps. These constitute of technical - the hardware and software, project - the process that introduces changes in the environment, and the operations - the process of keeping the environment working.They state that we can build effective technology if we can relate to each other as humans, and discuss how Agile is perceived in certain controlled environments, if it’s possible in an Agile fashion and still have prescriptive solutions. They end the show with picks.Panel<ul><li>Nell Shamrell-Harrington</li><li>Scott Nixon</li></ul>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">dee77326-09c1-489b-ba19-f1df7305f028</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2019 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/api.spreaker.com/download/episode/58847422/stream.mp3" length="43164813" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Will Button, Warren Parad</itunes:author><itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this episode of the Adventures in DevOps podcast, the panelists talk about Agile.

These constitute of technical - the hardware and software, project - the process that introduces changes in the environment, and the operations - the process of keeping the environment working.They state that we can build effective technology if we can relate to each other as humans, and discuss how Agile is perceived in certain controlled environments, if it’s possible in an Agile fashion and still have prescriptive solutions.

He goes through each of the points in the tweet and talks about each of them in turn. There are only two points he sort of agrees with, and believes the rest to be absolute garbage. One of the issues with this tweet is that it doesn’t define what a 10x engineer is.Defining a 10x engineer is difficult because it is also impossible to measure a truly average engineer because there are many factors that play into measuring productivity. Chuck turns the discussion to what a 10x engineer is to him and how to find one. A 10x engineer is dependent on the organization that they are a part of, because they are not simply found, they are made.When a 10x engineer is added to a team, the productivity of the entire team increases. Employers have to consider firstly what you need in your team and how a person would fit in. You want to avoid changing the entire culture of your organization. Consider also that a 10x engineer may be hired as a 2x engineer, but it is the employer that turns them into a 10x engineer.Overall, Chuck believes these tweets are asinine because it’s impossible to measure what makes a 10x engineer in the first place, and hiring a person that fits the attributes in the list would be toxic to your company.Panel<ul><li>Charles Max Wood</li></ul>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">0d384333-40df-45e7-b0ee-1ee236ac6777</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2019 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/api.spreaker.com/download/episode/58847456/stream.mp3" length="59376832" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Will Button, Warren Parad</itunes:author><itunes:summary><![CDATA[Episode SummaryOn this week's Adventures in DevOps, Chuck talks about the recent Twitter thread about 10x engineers.

Lee and Scott mention that they share a similar journey, initially starting as system administrators and working their way into DevOps. Nell says that she was a Ruby and .NET developer before learning cloud technologies such as Heroku, Chef, and Docker.To someone with a programming background wanting to get into DevOps, Lee highly recommends three books - The Practice of System and Network Administration, The Practice of Cloud System Administration: DevOps and SRE Practices for Web Services - Volume 2, and Time Management for System Administrators. He mentions that they are technology-agnostic and help in understanding what is really going on in the system. Scott stresses on the importance of understanding basic networking, linux systems and commands, bash scripting and knowing the core fundamentals and interactions of the underlying systems. He suggests going for online resources, tutorials and boot camps which are plenty nowadays and easily accessible as well.Nell advises listeners to pick a cloud provider such as Digital Ocean and learn the basics by working with it, which can later be applied to any other cloud provider. She also recommends learning programming languages to get a good software development foundation. The panelists talk about working on specific projects and getting hands dirty rather than traditional learning, to enhance their DevOps skills.Nell explains how they implement the 'learning by doing' concept at work. She mentions that understanding how virtual machines and physical servers work is crucial before moving on to learning about containers. Lee suggests Vagrant - a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments, as a good resource for the same. They caution that while it is important to learn things during our time off, self-care and setting healthy boundaries is paramount. It is ok to take longer to learn something given that DevOps as a whole can be extremely complex, and working in a non-pressure environment can be very beneficial. They recommend Ops School for beginners which is a comprehensive program aimed at people who want to get into operations engineering.They then share their insights on monitoring and how to get started with it. Lee recommends the book Practical Monitoring, and Sensu - a monitoring event pipeline, as good starting points.DevOps can be considered as a technical as well as a cultural movement. To that effect, they discuss where should people start learning the associated cultural elements. Nell recommends reading the books - Effective DevOps, and The Phoenix Project and Crucial Conversations. Lee advocates going old school with the writings of Richard Stallman, and books of the 80s and 90s such as The Art of C Programming. They mention that conversational skills and dealing with people are critical skills in today's work environments. Scott recommends Google's Site Reliability Engineering books which have a lot of great stuff to build a solid foundation and are also free to read online.Finally, they talk about how to keep learning and expanding knowledge. Some effective suggestions discussed include extensive practicing, working professionally, solving business problems, building expertise in programming, and attending DevOps Days events and Linux Users groups.

The topic of today’s podcast is containers. They begin by defining what a container is, with each sharing their own definition. Containers aren’t really new, they’re just a hot topic because companies like Docker made them easier to use and has brought them into the mainstream. The panelists agree that containers are not for storing data, only for running applications, but that data can be mounted to a container. This is one of the biggest beginner mistakes.  They discuss situations that are conducive to the proper use of containers. Containers are best added to mature and large scale projects. They discuss the pros and cons of Kubernetes. The panel gives advice on how to start using containers, suggesting new users start by containerizing one thing at a time rather than trying to do it all at once. They remind listeners that if you want something to stick around for each deploy, it should not be in the container itself because containers are temporary. They talk about how to create a container, good patterns and anti-patterns found when using containers. They discuss possible security concerns with anti-patterns in containers. They finish by talking about other container orchestrators and how to get traffic to Docker boxesLinks<ul><li><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker</a></li><li><a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Container</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LAMP</a> (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) </li><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.habitat.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Habitat.io</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@nirespire/what-is-cicd-concepts-in-continuous-integration-and-deployment-4fe3f6625007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CICD</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker Swarm</a></li><li><a href="http://mesos.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apache Mesos</a></li></ul> Follow DevChat on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DevChattv/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARDBDrBnK71PDmx_8gE_IeIEo5SnM7cyzylVBjAwfaOo1ck_6q3GXuRBfaUQZaWVvFGyEVjrhDwnS_tV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/devchattv?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> PicksNell Sharmell Harrington:<ul><li><a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/digin/post/ready-to-drink-cold-brew-coffee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trader Joe’s Iced Coffee</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hbo.com/big-little-lies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Little Lies</a></li></ul>Lee Waylin:<ul><li><a href="https://www.magicsandbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic Sandbox</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Dodge-Hell-Neal-Stephenson/dp/006245871X?ie=UTF8&amp;language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;linkId=f06bfe7482dca8bb751ed6d7cc86e2ab&amp;qid=1548462018&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=devchattv-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall, or Dodge in Hell</a></li><li><a href="https://whisperroom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whisper Room</a></li></ul>Scott Nixon:<ul><li>  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24233708-an-absolutely-remarkable-thing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Absolutely Remarkable Thing</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Beautiful-Questions-Powerful-Connect/dp/163286956X?ie=UTF8&amp;language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;linkId=f06bfe7482dca8bb751ed6d7cc86e2ab&amp;qid=1548462018&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=devchattv-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Book of Beautiful Questions</a></li></ul><br /><br />Advertising Inquiries: <a href="https://redcircle.com/brands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://redcircle.com/brands</a><br /><br />Privacy &amp; Opt-Out: <a href="https://redcircle.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://redcircle.com/privacy</a>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">facc020e-777c-4cd2-9767-6f4a55a7a8a4</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2019 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/api.spreaker.com/download/episode/58847430/stream.mp3" length="49719562" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Will Button, Warren Parad</itunes:author><itunes:summary><![CDATA[Panel<ul><li>Nell Shamrel-Harrington</li><li>Lee Waylin</li><li>Scott Nixon</li></ul>Episode Summary The panelists introduce themselves.

They finish by talking about other container orchestrators and how to get traffic to Docker boxesLinks<ul><li><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker</a></li><li><a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Container</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LAMP</a> (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) </li><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.habitat.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Habitat.io</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@nirespire/what-is-cicd-concepts-in-continuous-integration-and-deployment-4fe3f6625007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CICD</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker Swarm</a></li><li><a href="http://mesos.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apache Mesos</a></li></ul> Follow DevChat on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DevChattv/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARDBDrBnK71PDmx_8gE_IeIEo5SnM7cyzylVBjAwfaOo1ck_6q3GXuRBfaUQZaWVvFGyEVjrhDwnS_tV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/devchattv?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> PicksNell Sharmell Harrington:<ul><li><a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/digin/post/ready-to-drink-cold-brew-coffee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trader Joe’s Iced Coffee</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hbo.com/big-little-lies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Little Lies</a></li></ul>Lee Waylin:<ul><li><a href="https://www.magicsandbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic Sandbox</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Dodge-Hell-Neal-Stephenson/dp/006245871X?ie=UTF8&amp;language=en_US&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;linkId=f06bfe7482dca8bb751ed6d7cc86e2ab&amp;qid=1548462018&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=devchattv-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall, or Dodge in Hell</a></li><li><a href="https://whisperroom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whisper Room</a></li></ul>Scott Nixon:<ul><li>  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24233708-an-absolutely-remarkable-thing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Absolutely...]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>2860</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d3wo5wojvuv7l.cloudfront.net/t_rss_itunes_square_1400/images.spreaker.com/original/2f474744f84e93eba827bee58d58c1c9.jpg"/><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>DevOps 003: The Tool Chain Crisis with Priyanka Sharma</title><link>https://adventuresindevops.com/episodes</link><description><![CDATA[Panel<ul><li>Charles Max Wood</li><li>Lee Whalen</li><li>Scott Nixon</li></ul>Joined by Special Guest: Priyanka SharmaSummaryPriyanka Sharma gives an intro to the tool chain crisis; the panel shares their perspective on the crisis and where they see this problem. The panel considers how to solve this problem and Priyanka outlines a solution. She gives examples of how to start the data modeling process she believes will help solve this crisis along with suggesting guard rails for developers. The panel discusses this solution and considers how this will work in startups and smaller companies compared to well-established companies with their own tooling. Priyanka shares how to overcome the “we invented it here” syndrome. The panel considers how to choose the tools and the criteria to follow when considering tools.  The panel asks Priyanka about The Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Priyanka explains how it works and how projects are submitted and chosen. She shares where she thinks the DevOps industry is going and how the true promise of DevOps can only be reached by putting it in the hands of developers. The panel ends with a discussion on developer compensation problems, an increase of workloads and the benefits and need for remote work. Links<ul><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://kubernetes.io/</a>  </li><li><a href="https://jenkins.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://jenkins.io/</a>  </li><li><a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://travis-ci.org/</a>  </li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://aws.amazon.com/eks/</a>  </li><li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2019/07/03/group-conversation-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://about.gitlab.com/2019/07/03/group-conversation-podcast/</a>  </li><li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://about.gitlab.com/</a>  </li><li><a href="https://meetings.hubspot.com/team104/adventures-in-devops-episode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://meetings.hubspot.com/team104/adventures-in-devops-episode</a>  </li><li><a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2019/01/15/enterprise-leaders-protips-for-scavenger-hunting-through-the-cloud-native-tool-weeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enterprise Leaders’ Protips for Scavenger Hunting Through the Cloud Native Tool Weeds</a>  </li><li><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/cloudnative/files/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-22-at-4.19.03-PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://blogs.vmware.com/cloudnative/files/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-22-at-4.19.03-PM.png</a>  </li><li><a href="https://linkerd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://linkerd.io/</a>  </li><li><a href="https://nginx.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Https://nginx.org</a>  </li><li><a href="https://www.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.cncf.io/</a>  </li><li><a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.envoyproxy.io/</a>  </li><li><a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://prometheus.io/</a>  </li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/pritianka" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://twitter.com/pritianka</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Adventures-in-DevOps-345350773046268/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.facebook.com/Adventures-in-DevOps-345350773046268/</a></li></ul>PicksLee Whalen:<ul><li><a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/loadsharers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://www.catb.org/esr/loadsharers/</a></li><li><a href="http://boringtechnology.club/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://boringtechnology.club/</a>  </li></ul>Scott Nixon:<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9Da3VsLH44" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Byron Cook, Amazon | AWS re:Inforce 2019</a>  </li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/</a>  </li></ul>Priyanka Sharma:<ul><li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/</a>  </li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6ZupYzr_Zg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keynote: Commercial Open Source Business Models - Sid Sijbrandij, Co-founder &amp;
